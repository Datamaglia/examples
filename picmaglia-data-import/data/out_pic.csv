"The Gentoo Penguin Pygoscelis papua, is easily recognized by the wide white stripe extending like a bonnet across the top of its head and its bright orange-red bill. The gentoo penguin has pale whitish-pink webbed feet and a fairly long tail - the most prominent tail of all penguins. Chicks have grey backs with white fronts. As the Gentoo penguin waddles along on land, its tail sticks out behind, sweeping from side to side, hence the scientific name Pygoscelis, which means ‘rump-tailed’.[1] Adult Gentoos reach a height of 51 to 90 cm (20–36 in),[2][3] making them the third largest species of penguin after the two giant species, the Emperor Penguin and the King Penguin. The Gentoo penguin calls in a variety of ways, but the most frequently heard is a loud trumpeting which is emitted with its head thrown back.[4]","mikeleggero","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95501411/690f42d9930bebb2339cfece1c640f6a6e9c2c87/3.jpg?v=5","-62.587778","-59.921388"

"If the Enterprise landed here on one of their planetary adventures, I suspect they'd have stayed a while. The location is Isla Carmen, on the Baja side of the Sea of Cortez, near Loreto, Mexico. The Sea was dubbed the ""world's aquarium"" by Jacques Cousteau; it's also a sea kayaker paradise. I traveled here five times, on a self-guided trip, aboard the <a href=""http://www.myursamajor.com/"">Ursa Major</a>, and with Sea Kayak Adventures (now <a href=""http://www.rowadventures.com/"">Row Adventures</a>). Every trip was memorable, exceeding expectations. The dry desert air where Sonoran desert meets a sea full of life is blissfully energizing.

"Inspired by the lyrics of my favorite band, Marillion:

""I think I have become one of the hollow men 
As I shine on the outside more these days 
I can feel the outside feeding on my inside 
Leaves a growing darkness in it's place 
I think I have become one of the hollow men.""
(Steve Hogarth)

This song is (at least I interpret it this way) about modern day people who are so busy acting out their social role each day that they loose themselves and become hollow within.

"The moon rises over the ocean to the east at Cape Reinga at the top of the North Island of New Zealand.

Cape Reinga is the north western most tip of the Aupouri Peninsula. The remote coastline is surrounded by beautiful white sandy beaches including 90 mile beach and the giant Te Paki sand dunes. The lighthouse was built in 1941 and was the last manned lighthouse to be built in New Zealand. Today it is visited by thousands of tourists every year.

The official name of the cape is Cape Reinga/Te Rerenga Wairua with the 'Te Rerenga Wairua' component of the name in Maori language means the leaping-off place of spirits. The 'Reinga' part of the name is the Maori language word meaning the underworld. Both refer to the Maori belief that the cape is the point where the spirits of the dead enter the underworld.

"Entry to Cordillera Apolobamba, in Northern Bolivia.

Cordillera Apolobamba is a remote mountain range on the Bolivian / Peruvian border, a long day's drive from west of La Paz and then north of Lake Titicaca. This photo was taken in late May, and day one of our five day trek through the southwestern (Bolivian) side of the mountain range.

The local population consists mostly of alpaca/llama headers and stone houses, with with shy locals and semi-aggressive dogs. Like many South American mountains ranges, mining has been encroaching with the price of gold / minerals, increasing the prevalence of huge mining vehicles and roads to carry them.

Most days began bright but ended cloudy and cold as moisture from the Amazon to the northeast rose above the range each afternoon.","subdued","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95497159/5872a4093abd29c462012bc18bc7b13d394010bd/3.jpg?v=11","-14.858523033815038","-69.17060852050781"

"The Watchman | Zion National Park | Utah | USA

I am just one of many thousands who have stood at this bridge to capture this famous view, but seeing as I was 5,500 miles from home I was not leaving without my take on it.

This is one of my more technical shots captured and is a hand blended HDR shot which was focus stacked for maximum depth of field, then sky and foreground merged to replicate what the human eye can see, I could have captured it all from a single 'raw' file but found that I liked this version better.

"That's a new development of and previuos image. I found new tricks about nightscapes so i try its.
I'm looking forward taking new night images last summer :).
This one is taken during a night without the moon. I found these waterfalls next to the road during a hiking and i came back during the night.
Thank you mother nature for this moment !

Have a nice day !

"Sir Henry Moore’s sundial is both functional and visually appropriate to its location in front of the Adler Planetarium. A thin rod of bronze, supported by two intersecting bronze semicircles, marks the time of day by casting a shadow on the ground. The semicircular elements, joined at right angles and bisected by the rod, evoke the form of a hemisphere tilted on its axis. The sculpture’s golden patina and the subtitle, Man Enters the Cosmos, refer to the great expansion of human knowledge of the universe that occurred during the “golden years of astronomy,” 1930 – 1980.","mabel65","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95491729/24d8ec5663e5d7a6e9d528e10b0123f2a90ae3ca/3.jpg?v=9","41.866428904704826","-87.60661125183105"

"Woman on the stairs of the Jama Masjid (Delhi, India).
The Masjid-i Jahān-Numā (the 'World-reflecting Mosque'), commonly known as the Jama Masjid of Delhi, is the principal mosque of Old Delhi in India. 
Commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, it is the best-known mosque in India. Construction began in 1650 and was completed in 1656. It lies at the beginning of the Chawri Bazar Road, a very busy central street of Old Delhi. The later name, Jama Masjid, refers to the weekly Friday noon congregation prayers of Muslims, Jummah, which are usually done in a mosque, the ""congregational mosque"" or ""jāma masjid"". 
The courtyard of the mosque can hold up to twenty-five thousand worshippers. The mosque also houses several relics in a closet in the north gate, including an antique copy of the Qur'an written on deer skin.","roberto_pazzi","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95490789/1c23fbee737858e8175cdbcbfb0981ea8dba1434/3.jpg?v=11","28.660466191644154","77.21277236938477"

"Titled: Persistence

This day was my witness to one of, if not, the best sunset I have witnessed in the Bay Area. I've been hit with skunk light the past few times and haven't gotten a good sunset out of the area for a while. I enlisted the help of a man that always has his head in the clouds. Fellow photographer and super weatherman Jeff Lewis ( https://www.facebook.com/landescapephoto?pnref=lhc ). He predicted a killer sunset. Yes, folks that's what he does and that's what his billionaire dollar application Escaype is going to do ( http://www.landescapephotography.com/ ). I believe Jeff! I believe!. I took away 3 portfolio shots on this outing. This is 1 of 3. 

This was shot at 4 mile beach in Santa Cruz.

"Madrid is the most lively city I have been in my entire life. This picture reflects past,present and future of a very emblematic part of Madrid in movement. You could have captured this exact moment at anytime during the night 20 years ago, now and probably in the next 20 years.

The capture was taken in the 9th floor of El Corte Ingles in Plaza de Callao in Madrid. There you can find a modern market to enjoy magnificent views of Madrid at any time and enjoy almost any of the main typical spanish tapas in a luxurious environment. Here my recommendations: Cocido Madrileño, Fabada and Callos (only for the brave).

This is the beginning of a series of pictures from Madrid. More gastronomic recommendations to come.

Cheers,","javierbravo","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95486923/70bf5b70e461906316a51309c1fc3f71c5f53eec/3.jpg?v=8","40.420141025325236","-3.7054583430290218"

"Loch Alsh (from the Scottish Gaelic Loch Aillse, ""foaming lake""[1]) is a sea inlet between the isle of Skye in the Inner Hebrides and the Northwest Highlands of Scotland. The name is also used to described the surrounding country and the feudal holdings around the loch. The area is rich in history, and is increasingly popular with tourists.

The hilly country around Loch Alsh has a temperate, well-watered climate. There is some pasture and woodland, but much of the area is moorland. The rocks are ancient Precambrian Gneiss, some of the oldest in the world, much eroded.","AldisOzols","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95486881/80cc8c3f3f1fec1500a6eb95126c3ec22fbab07e/3.jpg?v=11","57.27310364731209","-5.725421905517578"

It is situated in the south-eastern part of the administrative area of the city of Žilina (northern part of Slovakia), surrounded by the most important Slovak mountains - Vysoké Tatry (High Tatras) in the east, Západné Tatry (West Tatras) and Chočské vrchy (Chočské Hills) in the north, Nízke Tatry (Low Tatras) in the south and Veľká Fatra (Great Fatra) in the west. All these unique mountains with breathtaking valleys offer very suitable facilities for hiking, mountain biking, but first of all for winter sports. Ski centers offer outstanding conditions for down-hill as well as cross-country skiing. The ski centers in Demänovská dolina (Demänovská Valley), Malinné, Jasná, Chopok, Bocká dolina (Bocká Valley) and Jánska dolina (Jánska Valley) belong to the most visited. For those who are looking for alpine skiing we can recommend the valley - Žiarska and Demänovská. Besides of skiing and tourism, this region offers also other less traditional sports such as paragliding, rafting, horse riding, speleoservice, joy flights, rock-climbing, cycling, hunting or fishing. The longest Slovak river Váh (403 km) flows through the region. In its central part there is a water reservoir Liptovská Mara with important centers of summer recreation and water sports. It comprises the districts of Liptovský Mikuláš and Ružomberok.","rumansky","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95486507/14c1bffc664ff1741cffd852a297bec66e018b6e/3.jpg?v=11","49.151173244278","19.34293270111084"

Trying and Trying again.
This time I went to a lighthouse on the coast of the netherlands. A small village called Urk. Although knowing that the sundown  is not perfect at this time of the year, I gave it a try.
Urk is a very nice and calm village at this time of the year.

Unluckily the wether wasnt very nice. Most of the time the sky was very flat and white. No sun came out to create a special moment. 

Made some pictures and different compositons. I will definitly come back here.
Hopefully the next time there will be a better sun-setup.

"Östersund city (Sweden) with Arctura in the center surrounded by a statue of ""The Great-Lake Monster"". The Great-Lake Monster is said to be living in depths of the lake and was first spotted in 1635. The powerful lights comes from the ski stadium that have been host for many big international skiing competitions. Next up is the World Cup, 14th to 15th of February 2015. 

To the right of the Great-Lake Monster one can also see the Big Dipper.

To create the picture I shoot it using a focal length of 105 mm to compress the scene as the statue is quite far from the city center. I also had to make three different exposures, one for the city, one for the statue and one for the stars.","kriban","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95484385/f6692590710284a6a9e2233abab07826f9737f5e/3.jpg?v=11","63.17008754830226","14.610443115234375"

"Cabo Sao Vicente, Portugal.
The edge of the world... According to the Roman Empire.

This was a popular spot for sunset, with a whole lot of people sitting on the edge of the cliffs, having a drink, waiting for the sun to go down.

Unfortunately there were no clouds in the sky, but it was stunning nonetheless.  And as the sun was setting the full moon rose in the east, providing some great soft light.

Top frame was 3 shots (one for sky, one for sea and lighthouse, and one for the cliffs) blended manually

"Here is Kristel!
I decided to go for an awesome black & white conversion while retaining the light leak ""flare"" effect (the less contrasty areas).
The double-exposure-strobo effect has been created by the lights, straight out of the camera; NO Photoshop involved to create the effect - thanks to Elinchrom ELC creative lighting.
We wanted to be extra creative, so I decided to work with stroboscopic and delay effects. With the camera on a tripod I opened the shutter for 1,3 seconds. Within those seconds I made multiple flashes with the background lights to create multiple silhouettes of her arms and at the end of the exposure, at 1,2 seconds, I fired the main key light to freeze her and to light the front.

Hans van Eijsden Photography, The Netherlands
Lens: Canon EF 85mm f/1.2L II USM on full frame.

Light: Beauty Dish with grid from the front-top-side, as key light which creates the higher contrast in her face. The grid restricts the light and bundles it to her face. I used several small flagged lights with snoots pointing to the legs, the hair and the arms from behind, all with grids and flagged.
I measured the light with the Sekonic L-758DR.

Postprocessing: ColorChecker Passport profiling. Local selective curves and some subtle clone work near the hair. Converting to greyscale.

"In my opinion Lake Powell is one of the best examples of how man intrusion can make our Earth even more beautiful. This surrealistic landscape of crystal-clear lake surrounded by colorful canyons, peaks and buttes is a perennial favorite location for landscape photographers.
Some places and some angles here are reachable by air only, so I planned and completed several aerial photo-expeditions in the area.

This image is taken a little after the image I posted some days ago. Walking back towards the cliffs, away from this rock, I spotted a composition I needed to get before it got too dark.
I'm still surprised I managed to stay dry when taking this image, as all of a sudden a series of bigger weaves rushed in where I was standing! 
If you haven't checked it out yet,  <a href=""http://www.choiberg.com/blog/reykjanes-peninsula-sunset""> I've written a blog about this day and some stories behinds the images! </a>

Also, if you live in the areas around Kongsberg, Norway and want to learn how to use your camera, I am now doing 1 to 1 classes out in the field! Send me a message to get more information and prices!

"Photo taken at the Nea Kameni Volcano, while I was in a one-day tour through various islands in Santorini, Greece. The temperature was between 45ºC and 50ºC (113ºF and 122ºF) when I was taking this photo, near Nea Kameni's active volcanic center, which last eruption dates back to 1956.
You can also see the Santorini Caldera in the Aegean Sea and Santorni's capital city, Fira, on the background.

"Quand vous serez bien vieille, au soir, à la chandelle,
Assise auprès du feu, dévidant et filant,
Direz, chantant mes vers, en vous émerveillant :
« Ronsard me célébrait du temps que j’étais belle ! »

Lors, vous n’aurez servante oyant telle nouvelle,
Déjà sous le labeur à demi sommeillant,
Qui au bruit de Ronsard ne s’aille réveillant,
Bénissant votre nom de louange immortelle.

Je serais sous la terre, et, fantôme sans os,
Par les ombres myrteux je prendrai mon repos ;
Vous serez au foyer une vieille accroupie,

Regrettant mon amour et votre fier dédain.
Vivez, si m’en croyez, n’attendez à demain :
Cueillez dès aujourd’hui les roses de la vie.

"This view of Mesa Arch is one of the most iconic views in all of the National Parks, and one of the easiest to get to. The only thing you really have to do is get up early enough to get there by dawn. Just don’t expect to be there alone! Unlike other down destinations that I’ve been to alone, the sun almost never rises to find Mesa Arch vacant of eager photographers. Even with the lack of solitude, watching the sun rise and the bottom of the arch start to glow red is an amazing sight.

Few places can compare to the unique beauty of Sedona, Arizona.  The soil is as red as the mountains nearby.  In some ways Sedona is the inverse of the Grand Canyon.  There, you gaze down into the striated layers of rock; in Sedona they rise above you.  My bucket list includes a longer stay here with more opportunities to really get out and shoot this region.  I had a brief window of about 15 minutes that fortunately coincided with sunset, so I ""made hay while the sun shown"".  I use a wide angle lens here to include the context the dried grasses of winter along with the rich, red color of the soil.  Enjoy!

"Sant'Agata de' Goti is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Benevento in the Italian region Campania, located about 35 km northeast of Naples and about 25 km west of Benevento near the Monte Taburno.

The name does not derive from the Gothic domination of Italy (5th-6th centuries), but from the Gascony family De Goth who held it in the 14th century.

Sant'Agata is not far from the ancient Samnite town of Saticula.

Main sights:
Cathedral (Duomo), founded in the 10th century. Due to the repeated reconstruction, little remains of the original edifice. The Romanesque crypt shows parts which could belong to several pre-existing buildings, including Roman or earlier ones.
Church of Santa Menna (10th century).
Castle, used as Ducal Palace.
Palace and church of St. Francis (1282).
Gothic church of the Annunziata (13th century). It houses 15th-century frescoes, and a diptych of the Annunciation dating to the same age.
The Council Room in City Hall was decorated in 1899 by Vincenzo Severino.","domenicoraucci","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95469023/6251a371c67b5f36bd995b3a5462bfc8124538d7/3.jpg?v=10","41.089087657019185","14.502489566802979"

"Roosevelt Point, North Rim, Grand Canyon

A view of Tritle Peak on the north rim of the Grand Canyon, just before sunset on a day of beautifully unsettled weather.  We are looking northeast towards the cliffs of the Desert Facade.  They mark the eastern edge of the Marble Canyon, the canyon of the Colorado River that becomes the Grand Canyon in a few more miles.  Further beyond is the Marble Plateau.

Incidentally there is no marble in these parts, just the occasional highly polished limestone that John Wesley Powell thought looked very pretty as his exploring expedition floated down the Colorado River.","lougheed","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95466589/4cb312180d39f725c4457a257f900d812292353c/3.jpg?v=8","36.219028","-111.952019"

"This is the Nordenskjöld Lake, located in Torres del Paine National Park. Chilean Patagonia. Is incredible how emerald this water color is, even with a cloudy sky. I took that photo during the 'W Trekking' around the park. That day i walked 18 km around that like, seeing a lot of breathtaking views. To bad i didn't have a good camera to take the real size of the moment, but i guess that i can show a little with my pictures!

"This is a new edit of an old photo.  I wish there was a way to replace that one with this one but I can't find it so I'm posting it again.  I started from scratch and ended up with what I think is a much more balanced photo.  The high contrast in the sky looked artificial before and took away from the sense of depth.  I also had lost some of the contrast in the mountains from the cloudy sky that I retained this time around.

"This scenery welcomed me at Öskjuhlíð hill, new fallen snow that nobody had walked over, so what waited me was a challenging walk through the forest. It is something special to be the first one to enter an area with new fallen snow.

I also still haven't caught up on missing sleep from having spent half a night fighting a slowly deflating air mattress. And yet, the mountains still call to me.

"Three wise men from Turtuk village getting together in the evening to gossip and discuss their day. The people of this small and remote village are extremely gentle and hard working.

Turtuk is about as close as you can get to Pakistan in India, physically and literally. This delightful village is crunched into the narrowing Shyok River valley in the furthest corner of India. Only when the Indo-Pakistan war ended in 1971, Turtuk (together with 5 other Balti villages) was then included within the Indian line of border control. It remained off limits until 2 years ago and keeping it well off the the beaten track. It was indeed the best part of our trip. Turtuk is in every sense a treat – culturally intact, untainted by tourism and simply delightful.

The inhabitants of this village are very hard working. They resort to agriculture to fulfill their own needs of vegetables and stuff. For livlihood, young work in Govt. jobs and old still resort to ""porting"" using their ""ponies"" and earning around Rs. 35000/- annually.

"Got to see one of the most beautiful sights a man can see — a glacier that meets with the ocean. The Perito Moreno Glacier usually extends or shrinks a bit from one year to another, so depending on luck and weather, you may see it very close or a bit further from the tourist viewpoint. For adventure types, you can take a boat that goes closer to the glacier. 

The Perito Moreno Glacier is a glacier located in the Los Glaciares National Park in southwest Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.

"return to my panning-wood series for a few days. this time without fire, the woods stay cool! 
made from one shot, with longer shutter speed, deviating the camera up or down for the effect. 
if you like it, try it, it is a lot of fun and the results are a great surprise!

I found it earlier today and from the look of the DOF I must have been shooting very close to this viper.

The City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia is a unique complex devoted to scientific and cultural dissemination which is made up of five main elements: the Hemisfèric, finished in 1995 (IMAX cinema and digital projections), the Umbracle (a landscaped vantage point and car park), the Príncipe Felipe Science Museum (an innovative centre of interactive science), the Oceanográfico (the largest aquarium in Europe with over 500 marine species) and the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía, (which takes care of the operatic programme). The Ágora gives the complex a multifunctional space. Along an axis of just under two kilometres that was formerly the bed of the River Turia, this complex promoted by the Generalitat Valenciana has striking and futuristical architecture, designed by Santiago Calatrava and Félix Candela – and an endless capacity for entertaining and stimulating the minds of its visitors. In its various buildings they can get to know different aspects of science, technology, nature, and art.","phigun","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95457183/fb8254c5b65621f97d80ffaf910834c501a7f215/3.jpg?v=10","39.45796580393599","-0.3560042381286621"

"A cactus (plural: cacti, cactuses, or cactus) is a member of the plant family Cactaceae within the order Caryophyllales. The word ""cactus"" derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek kaktos, a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is not certain. Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth. Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. Almost all cacti are succulents. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Cactus stems store water. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade. In the absence of leaves, enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis. Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north—except for Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka.","ArnabChoudhury1","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95456883/eb07fcf0d68de738b6e33791008478ac4362b2c0/3.jpg?v=8","23.5262183622166","87.31830596923828"

"A sadhu is usually referred to as Baba by common people. The word baba also means father, grandfather, or uncle in many Indian languages. Sometimes the respectful suffix -ji may also be added after baba, to give greater respect to the renunciate. It is also a term of endearment for small boys.

There are 4 to 5 million sadhus in Nepal today and they are widely respected for their holiness and sometimes feared for their curses. It is also thought that the austere practices of the sadhus help to burn off their karma and that of the community at large. Thus seen as benefiting society, sadhus are supported by donations from many people. However, reverence of sadhus is by no means universal in India. Historically and contemporarily, sadhus have often been viewed with a certain degree of suspicion, particularly amongst the urban populations of India. Today, especially in popular pilgrimage cities, posing as a sadhu can be a means of acquiring income for non-devout beggars.","PanglimaDurhaka","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95456559/ec81550c2c14fb581e8948de27fb5a9c17194e03/3.jpg?v=8","27.718788898837957","85.30059814453125"

"THE BULGARIAN SOCIALIST MOVEMENT

In 1891, as the last of the Turks were being expelled from Bulgaria after 500 years of Ottoman rule, it was here on Mount Buzludzha that socialist revolutionaries such as Dimitar Blagoev met secretly to lay the foundations for the Bulgarian Social-Democratic Workers’ Party – a precursor for the Bulgarian Communist Party.

House-Monument-Bulgarian-Communist-Party-Buzludzha-Bulgaria-2The House-Monument of the Bulgarian Communist Party was opened 90 years later in 1981, to commemorate both the 1878 liberation from Turkish rule, and the 1944 victory against Hitler’s fascist domination of the country. It was also to serve as headquarters for the Bulgarian Communist Party, who were keen to associate themselves with the nation’s historic heroes.

Construction of the striking monument cost in excess of 16,000,000 Bulgarian Levs – that’s almost £7,000,000. The majority of this money came in the form of suggested donations, collected from the Bulgarian people by state officials. There are more than 150 Soviet monuments scattered across the country, but Buzludzha is by far the largest – and the most extravagant – of them all.

The saucer-shaped monument rises to a height of 107m, and was designed by the architect Georgi Stoilov. More than 60 Bulgarian artists collaborated on the design of murals for the site, and thousands of ‘volunteers’ were involved in the construction process. The Soviet star which adorns the tower of Buzludzha was three times larger than that at the Kremlin, and in its heyday, the site was considered one of the greatest icons of the communist world.

Bulgarian Communism came to an end in 1989 and the monument at Buzludzha, being the property of the communist party, was inherited by the state in 1991.","AlenPopovi","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95456467/198f4f6ddb2a1c5c1f5e9ac48b10340b2a9feb8f/3.jpg?v=14","42.74575155146931","25.38957595825195"

"French Below, Now English (sorry for the fault):

I finally got everything I needed to ""manage"" my old Minolta flash with my Canon DSLRs. And yes we do what we can with what we have, and when you have no money so that DIY is a must!

So I have to use my DSLRs in full manual mode to manage this flash because is not recognized by my DSLRs (normal ...). Between managing the exposure time limited to 1 / 320s to avoid seeing the 2nd curtain on the image and find a good range on the position of the flash to not burn the images, it becomes sport ^^ but the photographic sports where technical (and a little luck) are required.

Lucky ... I have not, I have ever had and I do not think having one day so closed topic.

The technique ... I have a little bit but generally rated using a flash is zero points!

I hear the back of the class, ""but you got a Minolta flash, you have the use it before?""

Yes I Do! There is a long time in a galaxy far away ... (there's more than 15 years ^^).

So as I said it is a test not an artistic photograph !

We will start by Exifs

Canon EOS 50D
Sigma DG EX 105mm Macro 
F/9
1/320s
100iso
Low power flash command from the DSLR (not sure it's useful)

Flash Minolta 3500xi with flash sync cable
Low power
28mm 

Français:

J'ai finalement reçu tous ce dont j'avais besoin pour ""gérer"" mon vieux flash Minolta avec mon Reflex Canon. Et oui on fait ce qu'on peut avec ce qu'on a, et quand on a pas un copek autant dire que le bricolage s'impose !

Du coup je me retrouve à devoir faire du full manuel avec le boitier pour gérer tant bien que mal ce flash puisque non reconnu par le boitier (normal ...). Entre la gestion du temps de pose limitée à 1/320s pour éviter de voir le 2nd rideau sur l'image et trouver un bon compris sur la position du flash pour ne pas cramer les images, ça devient du sport ^^ mais du sport photographique où la technique (et un peu la chance) sont obligatoires.

La chance ... j'en ai pas, j'en ai jamais eu et je ne pense pas en avoir un jour donc sujet clos.

La technique ... j'en ai un petit peu de manière générale mais coté utilisation d'un flash c'est zéro pointé !

J'entend au fond de la classe ""mais t'as un flash Minolta t'as bien du t'en servir avant ?""

Oui ! Il y a fort fort longtemps dans une galaxie lointaine ... (genre y'a plus de 15 ans ^^).

Donc comme dit précédemment c'est un test pas une photo artistique et tout le tralala !

On va commencer par les Exifs :

Canon EOS 50D
Sigma DG EX 105mm Macro 
F/9
1/320s
100iso
Flash au mini depuis le boitier (pas sûr que ça marche faut que je poursuive mes tests)

Flash Minolta 3500xi
Puissance Low (faible)

""O homem velho deixa a vida e morte para trás
Cabeça a prumo, segue rumo e nunca, nunca mais
O grande espelho que é o mundo ousaria refletir os seus sinais
O homem velho é o rei dos animais

A solidão agora é sólida, uma pedra ao sol
As linhas do destino nas mãos a mão apagou
Ele já tem a alma saturada de poesia, soul e rock'n'roll
As coisas migram e ele serve de farol

A carne, a arte arde, a tarde cai
No abismo das esquinas
A brisa leve traz o olor fulgaz
Do sexo das meninas

Luz fria, seus cabelos têm tristeza de néon
Belezas, dores e alegrias passam sem um som
Eu vejo o homem velho rindo numa curva do caminho de Hebron
E ao seu olhar tudo que é cor muda de tom

Os filhos, filmes, ditos, livros como um vendaval
Espalham-no além da ilusão do seu ser pessoal
Mas ele dói e brilha único, indivíduo, maravilha sem igual
Já tem coragem de saber que é imortal""

I never was much of one for waking up early, nor much for black & white photography. But, some places suggest pushing past those preferences into finding something new.

Crawling out of the sleeping bag (the nice... warm... sleeping bag, mind you) at about 4:30AM each day, we made a daily pilgrimage down to the cliffs to catch the sunrise. Due to the great weather we had during the trip, the sunrises were a bit droll because of few clouds, so I started playing around with long exposures, neutral density filters, and alternative views of the area.","RobHansonPhotography","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95453581/fb7aa07690aabcb2adccf8835438a51f90f1e58c/3.jpg?v=9","44.311639802349504","-68.18952941684984"

"The floating village on Tonle Sap lake, it is quite an amazing site, the village has a population of around 1000, everything built on floating platforms, from the local schools, with about 300 students, to the church, the post office and the police station, everything is floating and continuously on the move. During the dry season, the lake goes down to about one meter in depth, and at the height of the raining season it can reach more than nine meters deep. Moving with the lake's mood is just a part of the daily life, no one pays any notice to it. Here you can see one of the village's two schools, it is being towed, with the small boat at the front, while inside the school classes and lessons are going on as if the school was built firmly on the ground. A great place to visit, but beware of the tourist traps. 
... Français... Le village flottant sur le lac Tonle Sap, il est tout à fait un site exceptionnel, le village a une population d'environ 1 000, tout construit sur plates-formes flottantes, des écoles locales, avec environ 300 étudiants, à l'église, le bureau de poste et la station de police, tout est flottant et continuellement en mouvement. Pendant la saison sèche, le lac descend à environ un mètre de profondeur, et au plus haut à la saison des pluies, il peut atteindre plus de neuf mètres de profondeur. Déménager avec l'humeur du lac est juste une partie de la vie quotidienne. Ici vous pouvez voir une des deux écoles du village, elle est remorqué, avec le petit bateau à l'avant, tandis qu'à l'intérieur des classes et des cours scolaires sont en cours comme si l'école a été construite fermement sur le sol. Un endroit idéal pour visiter, mais méfiez-vous des pièges à touristes.","marswashere","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95453241/5e536f73057f171a097cd0b423038a324b04ee8d/3.jpg?v=8","13.217417","103.845445"

"Mount Hasan (Turkish: Hasan Dağı) is an inactive stratovolcano in Aksaray province, Turkey. With an elevation of 3,268 m (10,722 ft),[2] it ranks as the second highest mountain of central Anatolia.

"In the past year I spent a lot of time outdoors, in the mountains and their peaks with sleeping under the stars. Usually I set the camera to photograph and I was looking the world. The emotions are unique, full of contrast. Many times it was cold, other with moisture... Some had both but the best was the last for this year where I slept outside in the snow. All this time I was thinking about what life is, if there is any meaning in this (life), what love is, and joy and many other thoughts that I had inside my mind trying to find a why.. Every time I go in the mountains I try to push over my limits and come back like a better person, with less ego... The reason I sleep outside is... But what I realized is that each person has his own way to see what they call life. Life is neither good nor bad. It's just life. Events and situations for me can be beautiful for and for others the opposite. Simply there are some common feelings perhaps as animal instincts that make all people to act like a common procedure, for example the joy that brings a new member to our family.. And finally what is important in this life? Does it exist? I think it has to do with whether We want if We were happy or not. Because if you think about it every day is a new day where We can make such beautiful things .. So why should We mess? Frequently the simple things are the most beautiful and those that give flavor to our lives. Everything else just filled the years pass... So why dont We pay attention to these little;; On my way to the unexpected many times I find my self in the most eerie places away from my goal but I don't forget that... In this photo I just lie to relax outside .. This is my own way to make my life nice..Find yours!
If you like this photo and my story to share it, thanks for your time.","Konstantinos_Vasilakakos","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95451509/f5d66b614326cbc6c3428e3d9be27ef8bde904ad/3.jpg?v=11","39.28721342935559","21.62388324737549"

My name is Mardy SUONG, I am from the one of Cambodian Photographers. I
wish to extend my heartfelt welcome to all international visitors and
photographers to Cambodia-Kingdom of Wonder.

As one of the
fastest growing tourism destinations in Southeast Asia, Cambodia’s rich
heritage, cultural and natural resources offer a full range of cultural
and eco-tourism sites that are both dynamic and sustainable. Highlights
include Phnom Penh, the Angkor Wat and the Mekong River Dolphins, just
to name a few.

The Kingdom’s capital is a dynamic city where
visitors are in the mood for shopping, dining, sightseeing and more. As
Cambodia’s hub for commerce, politics and tourism, Phnom Penh is also
home to many important institutions and monuments such as Wat Phnom, the
Royal Palace and the National Museum. The magnificent Angkor Wat and
Preah Vihear, Heritage of Humanity and World Wonder, is probably the
most exotic tourist destination in the world and the renowned yet very
rare Mekong River dolphins can also be found in Cambodia. During your
staying here, do visit and relax on Cambodia’s pristine beaches, explore
the coral reefs around many of our beautiful islands and trek through
lush mangrove forests. The bay of Cambodia has been inducted to the Most
Beautiful Bay of the World Club.

Regards and thanks!","MardySuongPhotography","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95449529/8d2fa1b364e0536e68d8f108e622352ac8fccb82/3.jpg?v=4","13.439437463524094","103.85656356462276"

"Buddhism in Burma (also known as Myanmar) is predominantly of the Theravada tradition, practised by 89% of the country's population. It is the most religious Buddhist country in terms of the proportion of monks in the population and proportion of income spent on religion. Adherents are most likely found among the dominant Bamar people (or Burmans), Shan, Rakhine (Arakanese), Mon, Karen, and Chinese who are well integrated into Burmese society. Monks, collectively known as the sangha, are venerated members of Burmese society. Among many ethnic groups in Myanmar, including the Bamar and Shan, Theravada Buddhism is practiced in conjunction with nat worship, which involves the placation of spirits who can intercede in worldly affairs.

"Altes Schloss

Das Alte Schloss ist neben der benachbarten Stiftskirche das älteste erhalten gebliebene Bauwerk der Stadt. Teile der Grundmauern gehen bis auf das 10. Jahrhundert zurück, wo das Schloss um 941 als einfache Wasserburg entstanden ist. In seiner wechselvollen Geschichte wurde es mehrfach umgebaut, ergänzt, häufig belagert und in Kriegen zerstört. Im 16. Jahrhundert entstand aus der Burganlage ein Renaissanceschloss. Unter den schweren Luftangriffen auf Stuttgart im Sommer 1944 sank es zum Großteil in Schutt und Asche. Das Alte Schloss, tiefes Symbol der württembergischen Landesgeschichte, wurde bis 1969 wiederaufgebaut.

Seit 1948 ist im Alten Schloss das Landesmuseum Württemberg untergebracht - ein Geschichtsmuseum höchsten Rangs für das Land. Die dazugehörige Schlosskapelle, die Mitte des 16. Jahrhunderts entstand, gehört zu den ältesten protestantischen Kulträumen Süddeutschlands. Bis heute gibt sie eine herrliche Kulisse für sommerliche Abendkonzerte ab.

Hier ein HDR-Bild vom untersten Bogengang im Innenhof.","Fotoarte","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95389031/102ef0664177435ca5546559ce8ce7f3ff745444/3.jpg?v=8","48.776944144836555","9.17919784784317"

"Taranaki , New Zealand

Over the years, my experience of hiking has somewhat changed. At one point in time, I remember that it was all about the challenge of getting to a destination and proving to yourself that you could do it. Along the way, you could tell a good story with some 'white lies' of exaggeration as a social lubricant during party conversations or embellishing stories in photographic captions. 

Then at some point in time, when work became too stressful to bear sitting at home, hiking became the ultimate outlet, an escape. I remember donning the sweat stained headphones, loading the discman with a favourite mix CD with 140bpm tracks and generally 'going' off while walking and making sure noone was watching. The passing environment didn't mean anything , the process and the time away was all important.

Then photography came into the fray. The headphones were lost and the destination became the target for an image in mind. Along the way other scenes were analysed and if the conditions were not good, there was a degree of disappointment that the photographic goal was not achieved.

Currently, I like to think that I'm taking the positive aspects of each of the above and at some stage in the future, it won't matter if this scene was whited out, I won't need 'escape' music and I won't be aiming to get to location within half the time recommended on trail signs. 

I did however , enjoy the conditions to this location at Pouakai tarns thoroughly and hope you enjoy the image too :) Incidentally there were 3600'ish steps to get to this spot  ........sadly, I really did count .....

"Cyclopides is a genus of skippers. It is mentioned in the Sherlock Holmes book, The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. 
      In The Hound of the Baskervilles, Conan Doyle wrote : ...Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard...   ""I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare, and seldom found in the late autumn"".
      The Chequered skipper or Arctic skipper (Carterocephalus palaemon) is a butterfly of the Hesperiidae family. Obsolete name - Cyclopides.
This butterfly has a wingspan of 29 to 31 mm. The uppersides are a dark brown with a dusting of orange scales at the base of the wings and golden spots, giving it its English name of Chequered Skipper. The basic pattern on the underside is similar but the forewings are orange with dark spots, and the hindwings are russet with cream spots rimmed in black. The sexes are similar although females are generally slightly larger. (Wiki)
      The Chequered skipper has been extinct in England since 1976 but has stable populations in western Scotland. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly to England were started in the 1990s. It was previously quite widespread in the midlands of England with isolated populations as far afield as Devon and Hampshire. It is thought that the cessation of coppicing in English woodlands is the main cause of its extinction. It was only discovered in Scotland in 1939 where it is found in grassland on the edges of open broad-leaved woodland. (Wiki)

"The main span of the Newport Bridge is 1,601 feet (488 m), ranking it number 70 among the longest suspension bridges in the world, and making it the longest suspension bridge in New England. The overall length of the bridge is 3,428 meters (11,247 ft). Its main towers reach 122 meters (400 ft) above the water surface, and the roadway height reaches as high as 66 meters (215 ft).[2] It is four lanes wide, two in each direction.
The bridge was constructed from 1966 to 1969 at a cost of U.S.$54,742,000 by the Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas company. The bridge was renamed for U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell in 1992, but it is still commonly referred to as the Newport Bridge by residents and historians.

"This photo was taken in my hometown, Tangub City, Philippines.

Tangub City is located at the Southern curve of D-shape Misamis Occidental Province, part of Mindanao. It is bounded by Mt. Malindang on the north, Ozamiz City on the east, Paguil Bay on the south and Municipality of Bonifacio on the west. It can be reached by plane in 1hour and 20 minutes from Manila, one-night travel by boat from Cebu City and 3 hours and 30 minutes ride by bus from Cagayan de Oro City.

Tangub came from the word “tangkub”, a Subanen word for rice container made of tree bark woven together by rattan strips. A Spanish soldier on patrol in the area found a dead man whom the Subanens described as bitten by a snake inside the “tangkub” when he checked if there was still rice in the container. Not understanding the dialect, the soldiers reported that there was a dead man from “tangkub” and the name stuck, which later on was changed to Tangub.

"Benny kam als Pflegehund zu uns. Aufgrund seiner sehr eigenwilligen Persönlichkeit konnte er nicht vermittelt werden und lebt jetzt seit 2 Jahren bei uns.

Benny came as a foster dog to us. Due to its highly unique personality, he could not be transferred and for 2 years now lives with us.

The Yorkshire Terrier is a small dog breed of terrier type, developed in the 19th century in the county of Yorkshire, England,[3] to catch rats in clothing mills, also used for rat-baiting. The defining features of the breed are its maximum size of 7 pounds (3.2 kg)] and its gray, black, and tan coat. The breed is nicknamed Yorkie and is placed in the Toy Terrier section of the Terrier Group by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and in the Toy Group or Companion Group by other kennel clubs, including the American Kennel Club,although all agree that the breed is a terrier.
The ideal Yorkshire Terrier character or ""personality"" is described with a ""carriage very upright"" and ""conveying an important air.""[18] Though small, the Yorkshire Terrier is active, very overprotective, curious, and loves attention. Mentally sound and emotionally secure ones should normally not show the soft submissive temperament seen in lap dogs. Because of this, it is advised that a Yorkie would not be suitable for a home with typical young children—they are Terriers after all. Instead, they make ideal companions for older families with many more reputable breeders routinely only homing to families with children older than about 8 years for the comfort of the dog, but more so for the benefit of the child.


Der Yorkshire Terrier wurde seit Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts von den ärmsten Schichten der nordenglischen Industriestädte in der Grafschaft Yorkshire gezüchtet. Die Aufgaben des Yorkshire Terrier waren, die Städte von Ratten und Mäusen freizuhalten, er wurde aber auch zur – illegalen – Jagd auf Kaninchen und als Wettobjekt im Rattenpit eingesetzt.[1][2] Vermutlich wurde die Rasse durch Kreuzung mehrerer Rassen erzeugt, unter denen am häufigsten der Skye Terrier vertreten gewesen sein soll, eventuell unter Beteiligung des Maltesers.Obwohl er zu den kleinsten Hunden gehört, zeigt sich der Yorkshire Terrier meist selbstbewusst, lebhaft, wachsam und intelligent. Daher braucht er eine konsequente Führung. Er kann dann ein Begleit-/Gesellschaftshund, aber auch ein aufmerksamer Wachhund sein, der vor größeren Hunden und fremden Menschen nicht zurückschreckt","PhilippNickerl","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95368591/abafb605b7ef78bf59fa76c41a002dedfb5e06cd/3.jpg?v=7","49.95066763688576","7.782268524169923"

"Berserkjahraun Lava Field | Snaefellsnes | Iceland

Halfway between Grundafjordur and Stykkisholmur is an enormous lava field created from an ancient lava flow from 3,000-4,000 years ago. Seemingly frozen in time, the elaborate shapes are blanketed in soft green moss, with vibrant hues of red and orange.

Paul & I were on route to Grundafjordur after driving all day from Myvatn in the North East of Iceland, we got caught in a massive snow storm coming over the mountain pass into this 'other world' of lava formations which promoted us to stop here for a break.

"Pentema è una frazione del comune di Torriglia. Si trova nella val Pentemina, a 10 km dal capoluogo, disposta sui fianchi del monte a 827 m di altitudine. Nonostante la relativa vicinanza da Genova (circa 45 km), Pentema è vissuta sino a pochi decenni fa in quasi totale isolamento per le difficili comunicazioni e questo se da un lato ha favorito l'emigrazione alla ricerca di un lavoro più sicuro e remunerativo, dall'altro ha permesso di conservare inalterate le sue caratteristiche e attualmente presenta un interessante impianto urbanistico, con le case di pietra addossate l'una all'altra e disposte lungo il pendio, le ripide ""crose"" in acciottolato, che scendono a pettine, collegate da percorsi trasversali.

Le prime notizie documentate sul paese risalgono al 1453.

Il bucaneve viola, facile da osservare a inizio della stagione primaverile in tutta la Valle, simboleggia questa frazione.","lefotodiroby","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95363869/808ab578ba236dcfbb8f86a555e3660d02f2f1de/3.jpg?v=7","44.540568831327874","9.130582809448242"

"Man playing flute inside the Jaswant Thada (Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India).
The Jaswant Thada is an architectural landmark located in Jodhpur. It is a white marble memorial built by Maharaja Sardar Singh of Jodhpur State in 1899 in memory of his father, Maharaja Jaswant Singh II.
The carving shows the genius of the sculptors. These stones are extremely thin and polished. As a result, the outside surface of the monument emits a warm glow when the sunrays fall on its surface. There is also beautiful marble jali work on the cenotaph. You can have some nice views from the terrace in front of the cenotaph.
The cenotaph of Maharaja Jaswant Singh displays portraits of the rulers and Maharajas of Jodhpur. The main memorial has been built like a temple. To visit the Thada you have to go through the rocky hills. This also lends a mystic aura to the whole visit.

"Homeless woman in Phoenix. This was my first attempt at shooting unknown people close up. My nephew (he's 21) and I walked the streets of downtown Phoenix. At first it was very difficult to approach someone and ask for a photograph. The trick is to spend time and be patient and slowly start a dialog. They were all without exception paranoid and therefore very suspicious and skeptical about us. We had brought Subway gift cards for them and that seemed to ease their skepticism a bit. Once we broke the initial barrier, they were genuinely happy to talk to someone and have their photo taken.

Of the 6 or so people we approached that day, 4 engaged with us and allowed us to shoot closeups. Here is one of those photos.

I also must thank Matt Kloskowski and his group (12 months with Matt Kloskowski) for their input in editing this photo. Thank you!","MehulDave","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95355037/e3afabc740864234cf5febb8a93aff1cb1ac93dc/3.jpg?v=4","33.458942753687616","-112.0880126953125"

"I am extremely fortunate this upcoming year to be teaching three workshops in Hawaii: Maui, Kauai and Big Island. I was just looking at some images from a 2010 trip to the Big Island to photograph lava with friends Mike Hall and Scott Schilling. We hired a boat to take us out prior to dawn so we could shoot the lava hitting the ocean at first light. Quite a memorable experience and one I would recommend if you are on the Island when the lava is flowing.

My June Kauai Workshop is sold out. I will be assisting Gary Hart on his two workshops in Maui (March) and Big Island (September). He still has openings.

"The Theological Hall is one of two amazing libraries inside the Strahov Monastery in Prague. Definitely one of the most amazing places to go when you are in the city. Even though you have to purchase a photography license(50ck=2Euro) it was definitely worth the money.  And they didn´t even have a problem with me setting up my tripod right in the middle of the small doorway!

"I went Through some old photos and found some that I like from the strong Aurora storm we got in the autumn. when there was also a lot of moonlight so not as contrasty.

Here Im facing Vigra the island where international and national flights come to, the bright lights to the left of the frame come from ålesund though you don't see it because of the mountains.

past the islands in view here it is the open ocean, so lots of the coastal weather. and Im in love with it. Ive always lived next to the ocean, so living inland is strange for me. 

This particular photo I'm right above a bunker from the second world war. which is a place i visit quite a bit actually.

if you are curious about what actually is happening with auroras and how the light is produced check this article or more on the net

"Famous Ginkaku-ji Temple (銀閣寺, lit. ""Temple of the Silver Pavilion"") in Kyoto, Japan. Tample was initially a retirement villa for Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa and after his death converted to a Zen Temple in accordance with his will.

What is seen to the left of the photo is Kannon-den, main structure of the temple, dated back to 1482. Initial plans were to cover the building with silver foils and this is where its name come from.

"Believe it or not, the first time I saw a photo of the Neucshwanstein Castle is only about 4 years ago (here, on 500px.com), when I just started photography. I was so enchanted by the photo that I knew I have to visit the castle when I'm in Germany. Well, last year I had a chance to travel to Berlin, so I decided to make a side trip and spend a night in Schwangau.

It was raining cats and dogs when I arrived in the afternoon and the whole area was covered by fog. The next morning, I made a trek to the Queen Mary's bridge at 4 AM. It was still dark when I arrived at the bridge. When the light finally (and the fog) broke about half-an-hour later, I was blessed with this view.","rsusanto","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95347343/6eafed48e6134e1b9bd2d8b287d7fa955df2bb00/3.jpg?v=10","47.569577036593756","10.735702514648438"

I was in the Ullapool area last October on a photography course and as we were driving back we stopped by the remains of a small forest fire.

The tree trunks, stripped bare by the fire, stood out among the grasses with dark trunks, partly as a result of the fire. The few branches that remained were beginning to show signs of fresh growth.

"""Titan"" is the name of a model crane produced by the Nantes company Joseph Paris. The name evokes the power of lifting gears. Both cranes have been preserved under the valuation of Nantes industrial heritage based on 4 UNESCO criteria:

the historical criterion related to the development of the region
The criterion representative of industrialization
The reputation criterion distinguishing outstanding or exceptional buildings due to the ingenuity of men
The criterion of technological interest, evidencing process or innovation
These factors contributed to the classification of a Titan crane as a historic monument by Ministerial Decree 27 May 2005

Description:

Shot on the Quiraing, Isle of Skye, Scotland. 
The light shining on the grass gives it a almost golden and extraordinaire glow, I have made thousands of images this trip to Scotland but this is definitely in my top five! Especially a metal print brings the colors and the illumination to it's full potential and makes it look backlit!, It is stunning

"© 2015 Thousand Word Images by Dustin Abbott

There are few things as truly grand as the Grand Canyon.  It's interesting the different things that catch your eye as a photographer.  I grew up in Arizona, and have been to the Canyon many times before.  I would have always have tried to find as unobstructed a view as possible before, but I found myself drawn instead to the trees that were full of character that grow around the Canyon.  I particularly loved this view, with the fabulous old pine as a counterbalance to the vastness of the Grand Canyon beyond.  I finished this shot with an old Technicolor 2 Strip (faded) emulation in Alien Skin Exposure to give it a ""larger than life"" sense of drama.

"""Cristo si è fermato a Eboli"" è il titolo di un romanzo autobiografico scritto tra il 1943 e il 1944 dallo scrittore Carlo Levi,...un ricordo delle mie letture di scuola riaffiorato alla mente guardando questo fotogramma...fuori dal tempo...come il paesino della Lucania dove lo scrittore era stato condannato al confino a causa della sua attività antifascista.","sabrinasecco","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95336661/b5848f180102754cfb80656802c5364449f291b9/3.jpg?v=8","46.481108204620874","13.523431601934135"
"This sunset view is from a park on the New Hampshire coastline.  It was one of my sister's favorite places.  How she loved the Ocean.  She came here often to enjoy the warmth of the sun, read, and to watch the birds, boats and waves.   Her ashes are scattered in the water on the eastern side of the park.  At peace in the waters of her beloved Atlantic Ocean.","TuckPhoto","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95336541/863bcd2b7a57561fe5418b54faee2fd5b1372349/3.jpg?v=11","43.000629854450025","-70.74440002441406"

So I'm a day late with this one. A bit of indulging over Christmas left me with a cold and chest infection in the new year. A week of working at a science exhibition finished yesterday evening and I had no energy for anything! 

This is a shot that I'm really happy with. My Dad and I were in the area for an outdoor activity day we got him for his birthday. (Outdoors and Dirty - odd.ie) We stopped for 15 minutes by the lake on the way back so I could catch this shot. I knew what I wanted but I was on the fence about it until I got home and processed it. 

There wasn't a whole lot to do apart from colour correct and add contrast. I added a little bit of a glow to the sunset in Photoshop but other than that it was a basic edit.","Paul_OHanlon","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95335013/1a09f8fe7ecb122121611d4d86b12010f8d8c508/3.jpg?v=12","54.13958769762005","-7.6989483833313"

"Idiom 92- The Big Picture is an English Idiom used to describe the most important facts about a situation and the effects of that situation on other things...

“The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close up.” 
― Chuck Palahniuk 

""Sometimes you have to disconnect to stay connected. Remember the old days when you had eye contact during a conversation? When everyone wasn't looking down at a device in their hands? We've become so focused on that tiny screen that we forget the big picture, the people right in front of us.""

"The most extreme thing i did in the name of photography... to stand on the edge of a bedrock. I stared at the angry sea for 10 minutes before i decided to setup my gears. The only way to get to this spot is through a narrow path of shore which is only visible when the tide is low. I took shots and tried to capture what i envisioned. The sea spray blows onto my filters, it continued to rage on up to my hip and chest level and i can feel it push me off balance a lot of times. One strong push could have thrown me off to sea. This coast is known and responsible for many lives lost at sea. My insanity woke me up when a huge swell threw me off a bit and folded off one of my tripod legs. That was the wake up call that i have to stop. I heard my mate yelling at me to pack up coz the sea had already closed the gap off that narrow path to exit. I had to cross and fight the swells as it merged together, closing the gap. It was already up to my hips, and the swells swayed me either way. These are some of the crazy things we do to take some shots. Not the best one but at least i had a keeper. And this... i will never do again in seascapes. AMEN!","ralphbellaphotography","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95323169/7d1e97eb8996dc63faad9addd665e25f72117e9f/3.jpg?v=7","-36.890158544767004","174.43501710891724"

"BEST VIEWED ON BLACK FRAME (please press H or click on the cypress !) 

Do you know what is the origin of those photogenic glades of cypress trees in Tuscany, probably the most photographed in the world?
These clusters of cypresses where, in fact, planted as bird traps. Among the trees, some of the branches and twigs, as well as artificial perches, were coated with birdlime, a sticky substance that prevents small birds flying away once they have landed on it. Italian birdlime was made by a complicated process of boiling and pounding from mistletoe berries. These birds, especially blackbirds and thrushes, were harvested as often as twice a day during the season and provided a significant part of the protein diet of the poor farmers who struggled to make a living from the clay soil here (the famous crete senesi). As in many parts of the world, trapping birds using birdlime has long been prohibited in Italy but these beautiful cypress glades remain, to the delight of visitors to this part of Tuscany.","EuropeTrotter","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95320881/c69e3a4efbb7d5615ae10f207a35ff908edc80b7/3.jpg?v=10","43.06186472916746","11.594974994659424"

Every summer when I go to Gothenburg, in Sweden, I visit the small islands of Västra Skärgården. Not everyone can be reached through the small ferries from Saltholmen.
Galterö, the island on which the photo was made, is reached by crossing the island of Brännö. The two islands are connected by a small bridge, approachable after making a small nature trail of the duration of about 20 minutes.
I crossed through the whole island encountering black goats and deer, while on the coast I saw several people who were camping.
Just when I was on the way of returning home, the ground below was lit by the last rays of the sun. I tried to find some element that could help me to create a good composition, but I didn't found anything; therefore, instead to lose this moment I made a simply composition respecting the most basic rules of photography.","marcocalandra89","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95320107/e98cb78ea11b25e3bc02c30d8270922b4a983ee0/3.jpg?v=13","57.65038404973275","11.754555702209473"

"Not far from Nanxiang Town is the Jiading Confucius Temple. I was not able to visit it during the day, but I was happy I was able to capture this beautiful gate at night.

The night in question, I was with a friend of mine who is a great photographer. He did not get out his own camera, but he helped me light-paint this scene. The image you see here is the result of combining an HDR light-painted scene with three manual photos taken with different exposures. 

Jiading is known as a “state of education” and the Confucius Temple stands as the source. With a strong background in culture and education, it is also known as the birthplace of talents and men of letters.

The Temple was constructed during the Southern Song Dynasty (1219), and has been massively renovated during the last 800 years. As a result, it has been quite well preserved. Today, the temple also holds the newly opened Shanghai Museum of the Chinese Imperial Examination System.","marcgc","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95318429/8e3448f77da27c908ff8b05cba3475707ca60fe1/3.jpg?v=7","31.382795468209217","121.24900639057158"

Near-Space photography is a multi-skilled hobby which allows you to explore earth's stratosphere without the need for enormous budgets and national agencies. It's fun and has got much adventure. It involves physics, extreme atmospheric conditions, electronics engineering, software development, constructions, photography, lots of risks, problem solving and money spending.

"This is Lake Marian in Fiordland National Park, New Zealand. It’s a 3-hour return walk from the Hollyford Road, which in turn is located just off the Milford Road (State Highway 94). As if the lake wasn’t a big enough attraction, there's also lush rainforest and river cascades to be seen along the way.  My family and I walked in here on New Years Day 2015 – what a way to start the year!

"This week I made it over to the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. Although I was especially looking forward to the Butterflies Alive exhibit, on the way to the pavillion we bumped into this beautiful creature. (You may have noticed, she's not a butterfly!) This is Athena, a beautiful barn owl who was rescued after being hit by a car left her with limited eyesight. With limited depth perception she has trouble landing on perches and would not be able to catch food in the wild. Athena and her friends (a group of seven raptors, including Max a great horned owl and several falcons) were adopted by the Santa Barbara Autobon Society when it was determined for various reasons they could not be released back to the wild. You can learn more about them at their website http://www.eyesinthesky.org/  And you can meet them at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History most afternoons (check their online calendar for times... http://www.sbnature.org/ ).","BillHeller","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95311741/12bffd291adf31fbb736d72787ae81daae463a3c/3.jpg?v=11","34.440513098828546","-119.71427857875824"

It was no less than a short adventure to capture this scene. I crawled out of bed ten minutes late, having been up at 4am the previous two mornings. The plan was to head back to Cathedral Rocks for another sunrise shoot. By the time I had parked the car, there was already so much colour in the sky 50 minutes before sunrise. Rock-hopping my way in the dark along the shoreline towards my target, I soon found a 10ft wide channel blocking my path. A few short expletives later, I decided not to risk wading across as I knew the tide was coming in. So I back-tracked and scouted out another suitable spot. I set up my camera and started firing off some shots. At the same time, I was constantly doing a jig on the spot as I batted away hundreds of mosquitoes feasting on me as their early morning meal. I resisted the urge to smack the ones sitting on my camera. I'm sure anyone who watched me from afar would have thought I was mad. Nevertheless, it was worth the pain and itchies in the end!","njephotography","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95307427/560c7bb4f8ed1136cab6339c9d0a789bdd008730/3.jpg?v=7","-34.64510688184414","150.8565652370453"

"Fully intact “giant” snowflakes are hard to find – the break easily, and are often incomplete from collisions in the air or with the ground when I find them. The bigger a snowflake, the more points of weakness it has… but when you can find a crystal that is undamaged from its journey from the sky, they’re always worth photographing.

I can imagine that this snowflake would have been beautiful at all stages of its life, particularly when the broad section of the branches near the center formed. This crystal has shifted it growth characteristics a few times through its life, due to changes in atmospheric variables – temperature, humidity, wind direction and speed, etc.; Snowflakes that undergo these changes are usually the most captivating!

You’ll notice hints of colour in the branches due to the effects of prism refraction, and plenty of inner details to admire. The inner-most star-like shape in the center is a sign of this crystal also being a pair, grown from a capped column. Its partner plate is on the opposite side, away from the camera (can be barely seen if you know where to look). This star-like feature connecting the two plates is normally called a “skeletal form” type of snowflake. The broad reconnected branches are called a “sectored plate” and the long tree-like branches would be called a “stellar dendrite” snowflake. These are all names for distinct type of snowflakes, yet they can all be seen in this snowflake.

When shooting crystals like this, it’s my goal to choose a magnification factor that fits the entire snowflake in the frame, but just barely. I’ll often choose to clip the tip of one branch to maximize resolution, and shoot that tip separately to add back in to the composition. This makes for somewhat of a focus-stacking panorama, but it’s not much extra work… and the reward is a higher resolution image!

There are all sorts of photographic tricks to get the most out of snowflakes, and plenty of science to explore too! It’s all found in Sky Crystals: <a href=""http://www.skycrystals.ca/"">www.skycrystals.ca/</a> - a great book for any photographer or science-minded person. :)﻿","donkom","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95307185/2effbd9fd3e2afafd45f24370aea5f963643ac46/3.jpg?v=10","44.413592","-79.65199"

"Italia - Verona - Chiesa di Sant' Anastasia

Sant'Anastasia is a church of the Dominican Order in Verona, in Gothic style, and it is located in the most ancient part of the city, near the Ponte Pietra

The interior, on the Latin cross plan, is divided into a nave and two aisles, with crossed vaults, separated by six columns each; the latter are in white or red Verona marble, with Gothic capitals

The current church was started in 1280 and completed in 1400, designed by the Dominican friars Fra' Benvenuto da Imola and Fra' Nicola da Imola. It took its name from a pre-existing temple built by King Theoderic the Great upon which was built the actual church. Since 1307, it is in fact co-entitled to St. Peter of Verona, martyr and co-patron of the city.

Consecrated only in 1471, until 1808 the church was held by the Dominicans.

The 72 mt tall belltower had four bells in 1460, the fifth was added in 1650. In the 1839 were casted the actual 9 bells tuned in C, them are ringed in Veronese bellringing art by a local team founded in 1776.

The church is similar in structure to the Basilica of San Zanipolo in Venice","dgt","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95300247/e70f1d89e354cb2f22021cb61e36e5b78c762ad7/3.jpg?v=11","45.44519477443112","10.99982500076294"

"A brilliant sunrise bathes the Painted Hills in central Oregon with sweet, radiant light. (BEST VIEWED ON BLACK!)  

I *almost* didn't get to shoot this.  The day before, Marc Adamus and I were making use of the harsh midday light by shooting a cave 170 miles away.  Upon exciting the cave, we took a break in the parking lot, and I did something dumb:  I placed my tripod on top of my vehicle ""just for a minute"" while I loaded my backpack and other gear.  We then made our way slowly to the Painted Hills, taking all day to get there, and camping there for the night, planning on shooting sunrise there the next morning.  

Well, the next morning arrived, and for the life of me I could NOT find my damn tripod!  Then it hit me:  I had stupidly left it on top of my vehicle and then drove away, which meant it was somewhere on the side of the road on the 170-mile path between the Painted Hills and the cave.  Marc graciously let me use his tripod since he'd already shot the Painted Hills tons of times and I made the image you see before you.

Once the shoot was done, we had a decision to make:  do we go back and look for my tripod or not?  We still had many days left of shooting together, and the nearest camera store was in Portland, the exact opposite direction of our intended path to the Alvord Desert.  We simply couldn't afford to lose that much time, but, on the other hand, there was no effing way I could possibly do landscape photography without a tripod.

So, with mountains of doubt and heavy hearts, we decided to try and find my tripod, which meant driving all the way back while scanning both sides of the road for 170 miles.  Marc didn't want to do it.  He reasoned that it was a lost cause, like looking for a needle in a haystack.  But I begged with him that we at least had to try, otherwise the trip was over for me, not to mention the not-so-small fact that my tripod and head cost $1,400!

We drove and drove and drove, but no luck.  Finally, as we were losing all hope we approached the final 50 feet to parking lot by the cave and THERE IT WAS, against all odds, sitting right next to where we had parked.  No one had bothered to take it or anything!  We both erupted in cheers and high fives and drove the 170 miles back to the Painted Hills grinning from ear to ear.  We went on to have an awesome next several days shooting the Alvord Desert and this story became one of our favorite ""remember when"" tales.

"Ohanavan was resettled by migrants from Mush in 1828. Perched on the Kasagh gorge rim, Hovhannavank is a major monument from the 7th c. and later, the best documented of the major Armenian monasteries due to a manuscript of pious history compiled in 1686 by the Archdeacon Zakaria. The monastery was dedicated to John the Baptist, and has a 12th c. fortification wall with towers to the W, a 13th c. church and gavit (a rebuilding financed in part by Kurd Vachutian), and an early single-aisle church. The monastery has rich stone decoration, and many inscriptions. According to one high on the N wall of the so-called “tapanatun”, “By the grace of beneficent God, in the reign of Queen Tamara daughter of the great George, in the year 642 (AD 1200), of the race of Torgom, we the brothers Zakaria and Ivane, sons of Sargis the great, son of Avag Zakaria, when the light of God’s grace rose and entered Armenia and strengthened our weakness in the battle against the enemies of Christ’s cross and destroyed their power and quenched their violence and the country of Ararat was delivered from the heavy yoke of their servitude, we wished to make offering and gave the tribute of grace to the Holy Forerunner of Hovhannavank...”","markosyan","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95294357/cb2b59b533bed0d77349d99eacedf57b3c650ef1/3.jpg?v=12","40.339609750472576","44.38873529434204"

"Aproveitando a luz do amanhecer: Margeando o rio Pelotas logo aos primeiros raios do sol do inverno, que mesmo em dias de céu claro tem sua luz enfraquecida pela inclinação ao norte, deparamo-nos com cenas incríveis que para mim são imperdíveis. A que se controlar para pensar bem à respeito do que se quer fazer, analisar composições, ângulos, etc, diante de cenas como essa que nos enchem de entusiasmo e euforia. Essa é uma simples imagem, rica em cores, luzes e contrastes, uma foto única feito como sempre em RAW, click na mão, sem técnicas como bracketing ou DOF empilhamento. Apenas um pouco trabalhada no Ps para atingir a atmosfera do momento, enfatizando luz e sombra. As configurações do click: 22mm - f8 - 1/800 e ISO 400.

Taking advantage of the early morning light: Bordering the Pelotas River beginning at the first winter sun rays, even on a clear day has its light weakened by the slope to the north, we find incredible scenes. What you have do is just control the thinking about what you want to do, analyze compositions, angles, etc, before scenes like this that fill us with enthusiasm and euphoria. This is a simple image, rich in colors, lights and contrasts, a single photo taken in RAW as always, click on the hand, without techniques like stacking or DOF staggering. Just a little worked in Ps to achieve the atmosphere of the time, emphasizing light and shadow.

"Djúpavík is a sheltered bay in the Strandir district of northwest Iceland.
It is a remote region, largely untouched by modern developments where silence reigns and nature continues to shape a rugged, mountainous landscape.

Djúpavík leapt to fame in the 1930s when a group of businessmen built a herring factory in the bay. The factory operated until the early 1950s and now contains an exhibition recalling those exciting and prosperous days.

For me Djupavik and nearby surroundings is one of the secrets of Iceland.

"On a walk through the ""Sierra de Madrid"" (near ""La Hiruela"" village ) we found some strawberry tree with a nice red color.

The symbol of Madrid is a bear and a Strawberry tree.

The reason is that, long time ago, in this area at the time were several forests inhabited by bears. In these forests would Strawberry trees, which give a strawberry-like fruit; hence the symbol of the bear and the strawberry tree often seen in Madrid.","joscarati","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95269579/5d37ebb64b38df4bd04053432bcb8f4ca81d2bf4/3.jpg?v=12","41.078185","-3.455647"

"A few years ago I visited and shot in this canyon. The resulting images while decent just fell short of what i wanted.  As my technique and Skills have increased and my gear was vastly upgraded from my last visit I decided it was time to go back and recapture what I didn't really feel that I had in my previous trip... The sheer epicness of standing on the edge of that red paved road taking in this epic vista.  I waited for over a week for some kind of clouds to pop up and as I drove in and saw the now snow covered Vista I was enthralled.  I knew the wait and trip was worth it. The clouds however had a cruel trick up their sleeves as a huge cloud came in and completely blocked out the sun.. it was dark.. and I was pretty dissapointed with the imagery on the back of the camera.  Then.. with only about 5 mins before the sun dipped out of sight the cloud moved away and the light poured over the then dark ridges and vista lit up in spectacular form. I hope you enjoy the resulting image as much as I did capturing this beuatiful moment in the Canyon.","JeffDeveau","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95268445/0b188fd4dc9228998b6a501e547e1430fd5129df/3.jpg?v=15","37.43758880744074","-113.19769620895384"

"Castelluccio Di Norcia is one of the most amazing place in Italy for photographers. Its wildness and very low light-polluted sky make perfect conditions for landscape and nightscape photography.

Awesome in winter for typical winter shots... great in spring for nightscape... awesome in summer for colorful flowers shots. :-)

This photo has been taken at the end of the March in 2014 when we got there for some night photography.

En aquest carrer hi havia hagut la casa destinada a vendre peix de la qual ja es té notícia des de l'any 1595. El carrer va rebre el nom de Peixateries Velles, per oposició a les Peixateries Noves, que les van substituir, primer al 1738 a l'indret anomenat ""Joc de Pilota"" (actual plaça del General Marvà) i més tard, al final del s.

"Our first stop at todays little roadtrip was Skagsanden Beach. It was cold, it was damn windy, but what an amazing photography playground! So many different interesting patterns in the sand, leading lines and what not surrounded by all these majestetic mountain peaks. Could easily have spent my whole weekend at this beach but many more amazing places to discover the next two days.

"This afternoon the weather was flat and not have anything specific in mind to photograph, I decided to go to a port 20 km away from Alexandroupolis to see it for the first time. Arriving not caught my attention straight away to the port but an opening of the breakwaters. Τhere was a small entrance leading to a small rocky beach. The picture consists of two separate exposures, one for the sky and one for the ground, since the dynamic range of the landscape was quite large.!

"This view beyond Mt Old is a highlight of the hike along the Mt Juneau Ridge, and one of my favorite parts of the view is seeing the boundary peak, Devil's Paw, far off in the distance. In this photo you can see it creating its own weather, piling up clouds to catch the last bright light of the setting sun.

I hiked (sometimes half-ran) along the Juneau Ridge three times this past summer, and all three times were memorable in their own ways. It was only on the hike where this photo was made that I pursued any serious photography, but the results were excellent. After time to think (perhaps enough), I've decided that this image is my favorite because of all the different elements that are combined in the composition. I think it would hold the most sentimental value to people who have visited this location.","TKMphoto","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95255557/ac0335d5ceb1b7eb8374d4bd5d775135774c6676/3.jpg?v=9","58.32824109970757","-134.33841705322266"

"As promised here’s the colour version of my last shot of Fairfield Church. I honestly can’t decide which one I prefer. On one hand stripping out all the colour seems to add to the bleakness of the scene.

"A sadhu in Varanasi (India). 
In Hinduism, a sadhu (""good man, holy man"") is a religious ascetic or holy person. Although the vast majority of sadhus are yogis, not all yogis are sadhus. The sadhu is solely dedicated to achieving mokṣa (liberation), the fourth and final aśrama (stage of life), through meditation and contemplation of brahman. Sadhus often wear saffron-coloured clothing, symbolising their sanyāsa (renunciation). This way of life is open to women; the female form of the word is sadhvi. In 2014 an all-female akhada (group of sadhus) was formed; it is believed to be the first such group in India.

"' Trail Blazing ' 

Blue hour magic at Monument Valley has always been something I look forward to whenever I visit this place. It's more like a bonus feature to all the visitors as if the already amazing Sunset colors were not enough.
We had planned on heading back north to Moab post sunset, but decided on staying back and trying out some Local Navajo Indian Cuisine. I decided to quickly make use of this time to get in a few more shots of this place post sunset just when the stars were beginning to pop out in the sky and then it happened. A Jeep with its high beam began descending down into the valley making its way through the winding road. I quickly set up my camera and dialed in the settings and got 5 long exposure shots one after another. This is that resulting picture from it post stacking of the 5 shots.
Sometimes you just need to keep an open eye and be on the look out for those moments to capitalize on. The Gold streak and the deep purple-blue makes for an interesting play of colors.
Hope you guys like this shot just as much as I enjoyed conceptualizing it on the spot and getting this end product.

I have taken this photo a while ago in a place I went to swim actually. It's called Ingierstrand, Ingier Beach in the Oslo metropolitan district. Close to Holmlia. This and a few more was the beginning of the sunset so I like the contrast and the shades. Usually I make long exposures, as I did right after this one...As a general approach, I use a GND attached to my lens, if not on top of an ND.

"When I photograph the bears at the Russian River, sometimes I get lucky enough to be able to shoot them without their knowledge  as I did with this bear …. with my chest waiters on, I was able to sit in the river and in a bush concealed from him ……. I must admit that I had to sit quietly, so as not to let him hear me, because if he did, he would have came over to investigate the noise …. the only noise that I was making was coming from the camera itself when I hit the shutter button, but with the noise of the river ….. it hid the shutter noise quite well … once again….. lucky for me","buckswildlifephotography","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95233979/644859986fc956f845896e6150bb832c0660c1cc/3.jpg?v=12","60.47870965937182","-149.974365234375"

"Ancient Egyptians believed that flamingos are living representation of the higher God Ra. And similar myths and stories run down through multiple cultures about these majestic birds. Often considered similar to the mythical bird Phoenix, these birds, with their bright wings are nothing less than fireblades across the sky. Even the mad king Caligula had fascination for these beauties. It is said that before the day he was killed, the self proclaimed God, Caligula had them sacrificed and sprinkled blood on himself for his mortality and vitalitiy. 

And today scientists are closing on evidence, that flamingos may around over 18 million years ago.

I have seen multiple times people calling two flamingos with beaks touched as a lovely couple. On the contrary, this is just another fight for dominance, and perhaps to impress the woman around. With their red and pink bodies and elongated neck, these loud birds do inflict serious battle punches with their beaks. Some go to extent of chasing the other completely out of the group. 

And all for the lady love.

Have a blessed weekend folks.

"Se penso a delle fotografie, scattate da me, che hanno grandemente influenzato il mio percorso fotografico diverse sono le immagini che mi vengono in mente. 
Una delle prime, in ordine temporale, è una fotografia invernale del Lago di Campotosto, nel Parco Nazionale del Gran Sasso – Laga.

Visitai quel posto per la prima volta diversi anni orsono, grazie al “guru” Alessio Graziani che mi introdusse così al fantastico (e allo stesso tempo arduo e faticoso) mondo della fotografia di paesaggio.

Stregato dalla vista di quel luogo vi riandai successivamente da solo decine di volte, alla ricerca dell’utopica condizione alla quale la fotografia di paesaggio ti costringe. 
Alla fine trovai la mia pace in un’immagine dalla costa ghiacciata che conduce lo sguardo verso un magico mondo di montagne. 

Sono alla fine passati cinque anni da quello scatto, e da moltissimo tempo non visitavo più quell’angolo di Abruzzo.
Preso più dalla nostalgia che dalla realistica idea di scattare delle fotografie ho deciso così di tornare al Lago di Campotosto. 

Il viaggio in autostrada, la SS80, la strada innevata della diga.. un emozionante percorso nei ricordi di una fotografia che soli cinque anni fa aveva modi e tempi di fruizione completamente diversi.

Ed alla fine è  stato bellissimo camminare nella neve, percorrere la costa sassosa, ricercare una composizione in completa solitudine, al cospetto delle montagne che avrò sempre nel mio cuore.","VincenzoMazza","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95231215/1d921bea5f75b2a8287b0314788a034256a5ebe2/3.jpg?v=8","42.52879629320373","13.390960693359375"

"Glacial lagoon is a large glacial lake in southeast Iceland, on the edge of Vatnajökull National Park. Situated at the head of the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier, it developed into a lake after the glacier started receding from the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. The lake has grown since then at varying rates because of melting of the glaciers. It is now 1.5 kilometres.","ottomrlee","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95231175/431503fffe5f11733bbc365ae16594c777a65944/3.jpg?v=7","64.04516598150778","-16.198997497558594"

"I took this shot this morning at Jetty Park in Cape Canaveral.  This is the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on it's way to the ISS.  Liftoff was at 4:47 EST.  This was my second attempt at photographing the launch (Tuesday's launch was scratched due to mechanical issue).  This is a four minute exposure, so I had one shot to get it right.  All in all I'm happy with the result but next time I'll have a much better idea of how to go about this.  For more check out:

Motukiekie was one of those destinations, that was very high on my list after seeing the first photos of Kah Kit Yoong here a while back. You will not find this place on any tourist map and you are unlikely to encounter any tourist here. As this area is only accessible at low-tide, I planned this visit so that low-tide and sunrise would coincide. It was 5am on Christmas Eve when I got up to make my way out there. From the side of the road, it is probably a good 20min walk to the rocks and I had this location all to myself shooting away, trying different compositions until the sun was too bright and the tide was coming back in. You can probably expect to see 2 or 3 other shots of this location over the next few months but I thought I get this out first.

I have seen photos here in 500px where people moved the starfish, so they would fit their composition. Please do not touch the starfish and leave the area as unspoiled as it is. There are literally hundereds of composition you could do at this beach. If you don't like how the starfish are aligned, keep looking for another 30 seconds and you'll most likely find what you are looking for. This is an extremely sensitive area. Also watch for the rushing water between the rocks and the tide!!!

Feel free to follow me if you like my work.

Cheers,
André","andredistel","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95214735/aa00041e43d86c87b7380fc17ef62e7c8dc31fac/3.jpg?v=9","-42.32327028500377","171.26466751098633"

"Rutting season at Bushy Park, near Kingston-upon-Thames.

I've been planning a trip to photograph the stags for a little while, however a combination of other commitments and less than ideal weather meant that it had to be this weekend or not at all. With heavy rain forecast it didn't look overly promising, however on Saturday night the rain stopped and the skies cleared so the alarm was set.

5.30am and a quick check confirmed that the skies were still clear. The anticipation started with a slick of ice on the roof of my car. This grew as I passed mist floating over fields and lakes.

The wait was worth it - perfect weather condition. The clear skies had resulted in a thick frost underfoot and swirling mist added to the atmosphere. Finding a subject was a little more difficult in the restricted visibility, however once I found a strong, energetic Red Stag, I spent the following 3 hours watching him round up his harem, bellow and grunt, and chase away other males as they approached.

The highlight was around an hour in. The sun had risen above low-lying cloud, which was sitting over London. It shone with an intense golden colour through the trees, silhouetting the Red stag. Where the light didn't penetrate, the shadows remained soft and pale by contrast - a clear sign that winter is just around the corner.

I won't be forgetting this morning for a while.","mattcattell","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95208147/2744b5937371f063dc35ff7dcc0696dd3de898d4/3.jpg?v=12","51.415481636209535","-0.3289031982421875"

"Just the perfect moment of sunshine after rain for this dahlia flower. That day had actually been quite rainy and pouring at times so this moment was a welcomed surprise. 


And just a little reminder of how a photo can make a bit of a  difference...  When trying to find the name of this flower, I couldn't really be 100% sure which one it was so I made it up. The photo of the flower from the website of the garden wasn't clear and so I couldn't quite be sure if that was the right flower. I'd say that as a consumer, I'd be more inclined to purchase something where the visual representation of the product looked good and like what I was going to be getting!","sarahverkaik","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95207945/ab85494db18c454fb33f6b2d8c00fccc6ff895a3/3.jpg?v=9","49.16868548163258","-122.25980758666994"

"*Owens Valley & Eastern Sierra from the White Mountains*

The elevation here is around 12,000 feet in the Ancient Bristlecone Pines we visited all morning. Now the road trip is over.  We have to get down off these mountains and home to San Francisco, about an 8 hour drive.

Just past these rocks we came upon a 4-wheel drive road that the Jeep handled perfectly straight down into Bishop, CA where we found a nice BBQ lunch.

*This HDR Photo*

Even though we were hurrying to get off the mountain, I still used a tripod for some grab shots on the way down. In hard to get to places, like this, it just feels like the right thing to do.   Three bracketed shots ( -2, 0, +2) covered the dynamic range just fine and processing is in Lightroom using the Perfect HDR Workflow and Topaz Glow.","in2photos","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95207705/f82ca013b03c489a9b1a7afe7c38035695256c2d/3.jpg?v=13","37.4450930010136","-118.20173297077417"

"I decided to go shoot a few seascapes late in the afternoon, and whilst in the process I found these guys hanging on for dear life as the tide was on the rise..and quick. Whilst set up getting this shot, I lost a thong and had a crab take refuge under my camera bag. The thong floated back to me and the crab didn't try to steal any lenses.. so it was a good afternoon.

"Hello Friends, ( Shines In BLACK)
Sunrise shoots arent fun and I am learning it the hard way. You plan the place, weather conitions, tide, cloud cover, sleep early, put the alarm on, bag packed and pray for all these things to fall into place for that one moment. But please never forget the anti-repellant..
 And when the conditions are like this, you forget it all.
A hide and seek sunrise from Mackay from last month. The actual sunrise was a little dull but the cloud cover on the horizon kept me busy. The sun was out but after sometime gone again and thats when the play started. I picked a spot, remote release on and fired to get the right shutter speed. 
Needed a 0.9 soft grad+ 0.3 hard grad to get a balance.
Hope you like it as much as I liked shooting there.(except for the bug company)
Enjoy the Light..","All4Nature","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95202841/d3e1a5cc15601841cc521c6317869c3a8f8d0200/3.jpg?v=8","-21.07036451477611","149.2280888557434"

"It's been at least a year since I took the last street photography that really satisfied me. To be honest, it's not that I have gone out to the streets many times in the last year, maybe just one or two times, as I've been more focused lately on landscape photography. Yesterday afternoon I picked up a fabulous Olympus 75mm f/1.8 for testing during the weekend. What a magnificent piece of glass!

"I’ve been lucky this winter to find a few weather systems that create snowflakes like this. Symmetrical, detailed, but geometrically simple to enjoy at first glance. When you take a closer look however, the detail is endless, especially around the center.

The center of this snowflake really ties it all together. Sitting above the rest of the crystal, this gem-like feature is the top half of a “capped column” snowflake, and one that grew outward far more slowly than it’s lower half. The bottom half of this pair had the advantage of more water vapour, and grew a little faster. As soon as the outside edges extended beyond the smaller hexagon, it had the monopoly on water vapour and grew exponentially faster. Branches formed, side-branches began to grow, all while the top half of the crystal remained a tiny ice jewel.

I photographed this snowflake 230 times, many of which were at different focus points to have enough material to focus-stack the crystal. I used only 36 of the frames in the final image, but I need to drastically overshoot to be sure I have all the necessary pieces. If one slice of focus is missing, I wouldn’t be able to complete the image. I have no way of knowing if I’ve captured every needed frame, because the camera is handheld the entire time. No tripod or focusing rail, and there are a few important reasons for that.

Speed is important – I need to work quickly otherwise a snowflake might blow away, melt, sublimate or get smothered by other falling snow. Even after a few minutes a snowflake will show visible signs of deterioration from sublimation (evaporation from a solid). I can work faster handheld, especially when I need to determine the exact angle needed to bring out the best features.

The camera needs to rotate around the snowflake. It would be impossible to have a tripod rigged up with the crystal at the center of rotation – the center is a tripod mount usually on the camera or a lens collar, not the subject. I need to change my angle and take a few test shots within a matter of seconds, lock in on the right angle and fire away my hundreds of images. For fun, here is the first image of this snowflake, shot at the wrong angle: <a href=""http://skycrystals.ca/images/DKP_9945.jpg"">skycrystals.ca/images/DKP_9945.jpg</a> I would have rotated the camera to the left or right, which also changes the angle of the ring flash attached. Once I get the right amount of surface glare, I shoot my sequence.

There are plenty of technical challenges to overcome when shooting snowflakes, and the angle of light is one of the most important. Want to read about the others? Check out Sky Crystals: <a href=""http://www.skycrystals.ca/"">www.skycrystals.ca/</a> - the 304pg book dedicates roughly a third of its pages to my entire photographic process. Worth getting a copy if you plan of shooting snowflakes this year! :)﻿","donkom","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95193519/9cdf3ffe7ea75632087ed9c7e946161e8e81566f/3.jpg?v=11","44.413658","-79.651937"

"Took these images in the pond in front of Ankor Wat as the sun was rising.  The crowds were staring at building waiting to catch a glimps of the sun as it rose over the building.  But i notice in the ponds located in front this grand building  hundreds and hundreds of lotus flowers were blooming .  It was amazing to watch as a few minutes before the pond was just green without any flowers.
 Hope you enjoy the image.","ArjunaSomaskandan","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95190811/a09c3b3d0e6980a5497ba0730ca7c5e771f0b9a3/3.jpg?v=9","13.413032","103.864895"

"Black & white landscape images probably don't receive quite as much attention on here, but I thought I would share this one anyhow.
This was taken on a gloomy, stormy day at Cape Kiwanda last winter. While there was no colorful light to speak of that evening, I thought that the dramatic wave action and misty, spooky sort of atmosphere made for an interesting transfer to black and white.

"The ship was built in the Caledon shipyard in Dundee and was launched in 1953 as the 8,003 ton motor ship Temple Hall.

The Caledon ship yard closed in 1981 though I am sure that the Dundee archives will have records. The Temple Hall changed her name to Pantellus in 1969, it was changed to its final name of Telemon in 1977.

While on a voyage between San Pedro, (Ivory Coast) to Thessaloniki (Greece) with a cargo of tree trunks, the ship started to leak off the Island of Lanzarote. She managed to make the port of Arrecife on the 31st October 1981. It was subsequently towed out of the harbour by a Fishing Boat to the beach outside Arrecife. A point of interest about this wreck is that in 2009 a sculpture was made with three of the tree trunks. It is situated at a roundabout in Costa Teguise, though on seeing it you will notice four trunks, one of the trunks broke in two and both halves were put into the sculpture.","kevinfoleyphoto","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95182669/51b303b23fa88da719d2be6631369c2c841e0a5d/3.jpg?v=14","28.971873814040713","-13.53104815352708"

"Do you want to learn how to create incredible composite images so you can make your dreams come to life?  Then Come Phlearn With Us!!!

Fstoppers and Phlearn are hosting an amazing workshop in the Bahamas this May!!! 

http://fstoppersworkshops.com/aaron-nace/

This class is designed for the beginner photographer looking to enter the world of compositing and conceptual photography. A successful composite image requires a strong concept, solid lighting and posing fundamentals, and quality Photoshop skills. Based off the workflow of one of the best-known conceptual photographers, this class will teach you the essential skills to create your own composite images.

Experience Level: Beginner/Intermediate


Our Goal For You:
You’ll learn all the different aspects of creating a successful composite image through hands on learning and walk away with the ability to apply those skills to any future photo shoot.This class is going to cover a lot! That’s why the whole Phlearn team is coming! You will have seven instructors working hard to bring you an amazing workshop, that’s one Phlearn team member for every two students!

Create Whatever You Can Imagine

Many photographers wanting to learn about compositing focus heavily on Photoshop. Yes, good Photoshop skills are needed for a successful composite, but what many fail to realize is that your end image will only be as good as the photos you start with. A good photo requires a strong plan and solid photography fundamentals. Concept, planning, shooting, and editing: a weakness in any of these areas will show in the final image. Over the course of 2 days we’ll teach all four of these essential steps.

Concept and Planning

It all starts with a concept and a plan. Often the excitement of the upcoming photo shoot will cause you to rush through the planning stage. It happens all the time, you’re so excited to start shooting and creating you miss a key detail that would really bring the concept to life. We’ll cover both the creative side of developing a concept and the planning side of making that concept work.

Photography Fundamentals

Strong photography fundamentals are a must when shooting for a composite. It doesn’t matter how good your Photoshop skills are if your model’s pose is boring or your lighting is flat. On the first day of the workshop we’re going to teach you all the basics of posing and lighting, and we’re going to have a lot of fun with it! Since we’re at an amazing resort, we’re going to get an amazing location, a couple of models, a hair stylist and makeup artist and do a fashion style shoot. Over the course of the day we’ll cover posing basics, lighting your subject with one light, two lights, three lights, lighting you background, using gels and creating dramatic lighting.

Every student will have time to shoot every setup, and Aaron and the Phlearn Team will be there to give individual guidance to all the students as we work through the setups. By the end of the day you’ll not only have learned a lot, you’ll have a couple portfolio images to take home.

Shooting for a Composite

For the second day of the workshop, we’re going to take everything you learned from Day 1 and bring it into a studio setting to learn about shooting for composites. You’ll learn how to analyze a background image and mimic that light in studio to create a realistic composite. To start, Aaron will take the class through a simple concept and teach how he would approach the shoot in the studio. He’ll cover how to match the light from the background image, chose the correct perspective, dynamically pose the model and many more small but important details. Then, the class will break into two groups for two separate photo shoots where you’ll be given a styled model, some props and a background image. You’ll use what you just learned to make her realistically fit into the background. Again, there will be at least 3 Phlearn Team members at each setup for guidance. Then we’ll do it all again, both the demo and the group shoots, this time with more complex background images. If you’ve been counting, that’s 6 photo shoot setups on day 2! We may even have a little competition during the final round of shooting.

Bring The Images To Life on Purpose

To wrap up the workshop we’ll jump into Photoshop and bring it all together. Using images from Day 1, Aaron will go over retouching and show you some of his favorite techniques. Then we’ll shift over to compositing where Aaron will give a live demo of some of his favorite tips and tricks, and work on some images shot by the students during day 2.

A recorded tutorial of detailed instruction from images shot during the workshop will be sent to the students a couple weeks after the workshop. Why a recorded video and not teach live you might ask? Aaron and Phlearn have produced over 70 advanced Photoshop tutorials and over 600 free videos on Photoshop. Photoshop is a very robust program, students are at different skill levels and everyone learns at their own pace. Trust us, our video tutorials are the best way to learn Photoshop.

But wait, there's more!
We’ll have Google hangout a month or so before the workshop to get to know everyone. All students will receive our Photoshop 101 and 201 Pro Tutorials before the workshop so everyone has the same base skill set. And there will be swag! So much swag!

We may be planning an excursion for Friday between the two class sessions. We’re in the Bahamas after all. More details to come.

What Students Should Bring:

Your camera gear. We’ll have all the lighting equipment including triggers. You can bring a laptop if you would like to follow along for the Photoshop portion, however it will be taught as a demonstration and not a follow along class.","Phlearn","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95174805/f64c1a36baf4815dd4b0e0fec291348445ccf505/3.jpg?v=6","25.025884063244828","-77.398681640625"

"The first bridge proposal [edit | edit source]
Intellectual ability to pass easily across the strait that separates Europe and Asia from retained its charm over the centuries. Scythian expedition to the Persian King Darius' army of 80 thousand people went into Thrace with the floating bridge formed by the juxtaposition of the ship.

Engineers from time to time on various projects with a bridge to cross the strait was also EEA to remain in their bill. For example, in 1940 the initiative of Nuri Demirağ projected bridge by Turkish engineers and throat specialist and when Americans wanted it to work, but by that time the ruling ""would bridge the throat is destroyed,"" said the offer was rejected.

Making process [edit | edit source]
Istanbul's rapid development during the second half of the 20th century and brought European-made increase in traffic between Asia and the Bosphorus bridge becomes mandatory. T. C. Highways from the Administration, the Democratic Party of crossing the bridge on the Bosphorus period field report as possible from the 9th floor Prime Minister Adnan Menderes May 25, 1960 in technical engineering (feasibility study, design, construction supervision and warranty will be given during consultation) to serve the Turkish-British joint venture signed a contract with. A few days after the realization of this project due to the May 27 coup occurred in 1965, but the Justice Party was it after coming to power alone.

In 1967, I was asked to prepare a new project from four engineering firm specializing in residential and makes appropriate recommendations to the Bosphorus BOTEK Technical Consulting Inc. and Freeman Fox and Partners signed an agreement in 1968 with the partnership. A tender to select a company that will perform the construction consortium won the British firm Hochtief AG has named German and Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company. Construction of the bridge was started in 1970. The cost of construction is $ 21,774,283 according to the agreement. Construction was completed in three years and 29th October 1973, the Republic was opened on the 50th anniversary of the ad.

The fixed link bridge to Europe and Asia constitute a major public transport network in Turkey from that period was held today at the very top of the expected increase in traffic. The first service was opened in the average daily number of vehicles crossing the bridge that was 32 thousand to 130 thousand in 1987, while in 2004, 180 thousand. In 1991, except for heavy duty buses (4 tonnes and above) were banned from crossing the bridge of the vehicles. [1]

Bosphorus Bridge was closed to traffic since 1978.","envermanco","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95173589/c128677a28b0342c298014dda0033c81beb0d52c/3.jpg?v=10","41.04699359153771","29.032573699951172"

This Photograph was shot under a Full moon known as the ""Wolf Moon"". January is the month of the Full Wolf Moon. It appeared when wolves howled in hunger outside the villages. This was shot on one of the coldest nights in South Carolina on a deserted beach full of driftwood. These beaches are knows as a ""Boneyards"". Boneyard's are called this because of the bleach skeletons of oaks along the beach. 

In this madness, in this world,
With it's swiftness and it's cold
You're my peace of mind!

And you know where to head to
You're peace of mind!

"We arrived at our accomodation in Hamnøy / Lofoten about 1 hour ago. Both the arch of the milkyway (Unfortunately the galactic core of the milkyway can not be seen from this part of the world as it is below the horizon) and a faint aurora borealis welcomed us with a little show behind the spectacular 'Olstinden' mountain. All seen from the parking lot of our accommodation.

Now time for some food and crossing our fingers for a better show later on tonight. One thing is for sure, Its going to be a great weekend!!

"Royal Mile, Edinburgh

The Royal Mile runs through the heart of Edinburgh’s Old Town, connecting the magnificent Edinburgh Castle, perched high on a base of volcanic rock, with the splendorous Palace of Holyroodhouse, resting in the shadow of Arthur's Seat. The Mile is overlooked by impressive, towering tenements, between which cobbled closes and narrow stairways interlock to create a secret underground world.

Peppered with superb attractions such as The Real Mary King’s Close or the Scottish Storytelling Centre, historical sites including St Giles' Cathedral and some of the best eating and drinking spots in the city, the Royal Mile offers much to see and do. For a glimpse of recent history, be sure to visit the ultra-modern Scottish Parliament, a striking building boasting a cutting-edge design.","mangeeriksson","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95148611/d719f4c30cc1e39a7ad0d2eed445d1f21f671b49/3.jpg?v=13","55.937356277960006","-3.186584464274347"

"In India, woman's clothing varies widely and is closely associated with the local culture, religion and climate.
Traditional Indian clothing for women in the north and east are saris or ghagra cholis while many south Indian women traditionally wear sari and children wear pattu langa. Saris made out of silk are considered the most elegant. Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is one of India's fashion capitals. In many rural parts of India, traditional clothing is worn. Women wear a sari, a long sheet of colourful cloth, draped over a simple or fancy blouse. Little girls wear a pavada. Both are often patterned. 
Girls before puberty wear a long skirt (called langa) and a short blouse, called a choli, above it.

There is a certain magic in those final moments of twilight when the city lights have just popped on, resigning themselves to the fact that it will be many hours til morning, while the seagulls settle in for the night atop each of the pilings seen in the foreground.

"The guidebooks all say to go to Salinas de Maras in the Sacred Valley around Cusco midday to avoid the shadow of the valley over the salt mines. My schedule only allowed for an a late day trek down to Urubamba, and while I indeed had no direct light, I was greeted with reflections from the peaks above down to the salt mine pools below. You can see the size of the pools compared to the workers hut in the lower-center of the frame.

The photo belongs to Reinebringen in Lofoten Islands. You reach here after some short but steep hike. Very recommended if you like such places. I would say it's one of the best views in Norway in general. I got here to make a time lapse which you can also find the link of on top of this text. About the photo, settings can be seen, a typical 14-24mm shot on a fast shutter.

“Creo que la melancolía es, en suma, un problema musical: una disonancia, un ritmo trastornado. 
Mientras afuera todo sucede con un ritmo vertiginoso de cascada, adentro hay una lentitud exhausta de gota de agua cayendo de tanto en tanto. 
De allí que ese afuera contemplado desde el adentro melancólico resulte absurdo e irreal y constituya ""la farsa que todos tenemos que representar"". 
Pero por un instante -sea por una música salvaje, o alguna droga, o el acto sexual en su máxima violencia-, el ritmo lentísimo del melancólico no sólo llega a codearse con el del mundo externo, sino que lo sobrepasa con una desmesura indeciblemente dichosa; y el yo vibra animado por energías delirantes. 
Al melancólico el tiempo se le manifiesta como suspensión del transcurrir -en verdad, hay un transcurrir, pero su lentitud evoca el crecimiento de las uñas de los muertos- que precede y continúa a la violencia fatalmente efímera.”

"On a recent 1-to-1 workshop we hiked up to this mountainlake under a crazy bright full moon. No need for headlamps or anything. It was Incredible to see this landscape like this and i think the client was out of words in pure awe.... Super strong winds gave the clouds Incredible movement and during our stay up there we went through all kinds of weather... Everytime a hailshower or insane windgusts came across the lake we took cover behind a shed. One of the greatest nights i`ve spent out...

"Zelenci Springs is a nature reserve near the town of Kranjska Gora, in the far northwestern corner of Slovenia. It is the source of the Sava Dolinka River, a tributary of the Danube.

At Zelenci Springs, water from underground Nadiža Creek (originating in the Planica Valley) re-emerges through the porous bottom of a 2 m deep lake, whose waters are noted for their deep, brilliant green. The spring and its surrounding area are named after this colour (Zelenci is a deadjectival plural noun from Slovene zelen 'green'.","BorR","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95123631/cac8f5840cfdafad77fb63f4452b9106dbc61230/3.jpg?v=11","46.49266083823322","13.737330436706543"

"Sunset last night on the Switzerland Liechtenstein border. This is one of several 11-12 image wide panoramas I shot yesterday in this location, and up in the mountains of Glarus. 

With my cell phone handy I knew when the train should be coming. So I started the panorama on the left around 2 minutes before the train would arrive, started firing away, and then waited in position for the train to arrive, Firing one image at the location at ISO 100, with a slower shutter speed, and then I raised my ISO and increased the shutter speed to get an image of the train with less blur. Earlier images in the day, and from the prior three evenings there had varying results.

If you like this image, with the bridge, alps, and train, there will be more coming. :D  Thanks for looking, and reading (if you made it this far)","pensrud","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95122423/46432a54ba3d24d5ac8f9a37c8034557fc758cf4/3.jpg?v=8","47.16894355562019","9.486694335937498"

This is such a nice street to photograph in the evening. The perfect place to really enhance some color contrasts.

Bracketed 3 exposures at 1 stop range. 
The 3 exposures where merged into a 32-bit HDR image in Photoshop, that then could be edited in Lightroom. 
This gives a much more realistic look than a typical tone-mapped HDR. 
After that I did some retouching in PS - contrast and LAB color adjustments with luminosity masks, and alot of micro dodge and burning.","thomasmorkeberg","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95114573/53fe8b9a5b39bed1549536e6c753275e34d45d37/3.jpg?v=5","55.68045779220803","12.588022649288177"

"The Berlin Cathedral or Berlin Dom for short is a fascinating and beautiful structure which sits on museum island. The building was finished in 1905 and is a main work of Historicist architecture of the “Kaiserzeit”.

This structure has a mix of architectural styles such as “Renaissance, Baroque, Brick Gothic and Neoclassical. You can spot this building easily when you are in the heart of Berlin as its beautiful dome towers above the surrounding buildings.

This was one of the many buildings which were destroyed during World War 2. In 1193 it was re-inaugurated after evidence of the war was removed. This will remain to me one of the most beautiful and detailed buildings in Berlin and is a must see for anyone who enjoys architecture. 

The Berliner Dom is located right beside the Altes or Old Museum which can also be found here Altes Museum By Shane Walsh Photography.

"The National Monument Of Freedom at the Shipka Peak is built on the place where one of the most deciding battles for Bulgaria's liberation from the Ottoman/Turkish Empire took place in 1877-1878.
The monument is a 31.5-metre (98-foot) high stone tower in the form of a truncated pyramid. A giant bronze lion, 8 m (26 feet) long and 4 m (13 feet) high, stands above the entrance to the tower, and a figure of a woman represents the victory over the Ottoman forces. A marble sarcophagus housing some of the remains of the Russian and Bulgarian casualties is on the first floor. There are four other floors where one can find replica of Bulgarian military flags and other relics. The top of the tower reveals a panorama of Shipka Peak and the surrounding area.[1]","AlbenaMarkova","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95110449/af59be6c952dd32ba535dfc5902224c0184d4ea8/3.jpg?v=9","42.79489680122178","25.3139591217041"

"The Hospital de Sant Pau Modernista is located in Barcelona and was designed by the architect Lluis Domenech i Montaner. It was built between 1902 and 1930 in two phases: the first, carried out by him between 1902 and 1913, consists of thirteen Modernist buildings; the second, made by his son Pere Domènech Roura and after 1920, has six other buildings of moderate modernism, as well as subsequent builds.

"High Speed Sightseeing -  We have done it all one time. I remember I was near Rome a few years ago with a group and we had only one and a half hour to spend in Rome. So we asked the companies taxi to give us the high speed sightseeing tour of Rome. 

We jumped into the car and off we went. First stop, the collosseum...just 5 minutes to take selfies and other shots and back into the car again. Next stop, St Pieter Square....ok let's stop for 10 minutes here!! 

This went on until we ran out of time and had to go back to the hotel to get our bags and leave for the airport. 

When I shot this in Amsterdam last night, I had to think of this sightseeing trip in Rome. The lightstreaks you see are from one of the many canalboats.

"This morning I went down to East Beach, hoping for a beautiful sunrise, but it clouded over and I got nothing.  This evening I went out to Campus Point, not knowing if the clouds would break... they did!  It was a spectacular sunset, more than making up for a disappointing sunrise.","RobLaskin","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95102439/9301bb716cc3cdd1957aedc9e52ba10cd63f0e9e/3.jpg?v=10","34.405493360307624","-119.84635161934419"
"Sunrise approaches Wynn Mountain and the Swiftcurrent Creek area, as viewed from a nearby overlook. A well-known view in the Many Glacier area of Glacier National Park in Montana. This was my first time scrambling up to this general area and I must say, it really is quite incredible...yet, also a bit scary doing it in the dark at 4:30 am before sunrise and running on 3 hours of sleep. I opted for a different viewpoint on the lower part of the ridge, instead of the more commonly photographed scene much higher up when I came across this lone tree, which I found to be interesting in appearance.
Definitely best if viewed on a darker background.

"Hello Friends,( only in BLACK)
A Day in the life of a seascape shooter. Can you see yourself??
This shot is called a photographers moment and was actually a moment three photographers will remember.
 I, the one who shot it was all set up, remote release on, tripod mounted and waiting for the splash to press the shutter. I will remember it a s a moment when I caught the big splash and also because I was on the exact spot the other photographer was on a few minutes ago. I was shooting on the edge and noticed this gentleman right behind me and I moved on telling him ""Have fun.""
The person close to the splash was a fellow photographer whom we met while shooting and kept changing vantage points. The splash caught us by surprise but as a true photographer, he chose to cover and save the gear then run back. 
The third is my friend Lin Zee, also in the picture, at another vantage point against the big rock. He was already wet from an earlier splash and was all smiles after this happened.
Its moments like thgese we remember for a long time.
Have a Great weekend.","All4Nature","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95090547/3274b85e6cb2f076e4b2c463c375cbddecdc985e/3.jpg?v=13","-34.64940086103483","150.86426585912702"

""Built nearly 1,000 years ago, the Alekoko Menehune Fishpond, minutes from Lihue, has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1973. Ingenious ponds like this were built to catch fish, and the Menehune Fishpond is one of the finest examples of this type of ancient Hawaiian aquaculture.""

""The legend that surrounds the fishpond is based on the mythical Menehune, Hawaii's mischievous little people who performed legendary engineering feats.

Spent some time in the Big Sur area just before the holidays with Erin Babnik, Michael Shainblum, and Susan Holt. The several days I spent there bore little fruit, but finding something like this makes it all worthwhile for me. I came home with no other images, but a very dramatic section of coast line pounded by surf following several days of storms, and a last minute tiny break in the sky gave me something I could be excited about. Good times with good friends, building tripod sculptures in a cheap motel room, and a dead car battery that I had to have jumped twice to get home is what I will remember when I look at this for years to come.","TedGore","https://ppcdn.500px.org/95006535/11918d0463ff65ae8d718afead362719a77cb123/3.jpg?v=10","36.42404502109946","-121.91253662109376"

"I can feel in my heart that 2015 is going to be a wonderful year for travel and I honestly can’t think of another time in my life where I’ve felt so excited and optimistic about the future. We live in a beautiful world that’s just waiting to be explored and this year, I plan on seeking out new destinations that will challenge my senses and help to propel my photography in new directions. I also plan on post-processing many new images from my five year working archive, like this one from the stunning Provence region of Southern France. 

My wife and I visited this area last July and we instantly fell in love with the seemingly endless lavender fields. From a photographer’s standpoint, it’s a composition and leading line paradise where the color combinations never cease to impress. From a travelers eye, it’s almost unbelievable that this place actually exists and that it's fully accessible to anyone who wants to visit. The only guardians to these lovely rows of fragrant lavender are the millions of buzzing bees that fill the air with a soft harmonious hum. 

On a side note, after being stung 4 times, this was also the trip where I confirmed that I’m not allergic to bees, thankfully. ;)

This westward facing jetty in the town of Thames is about 1 hour from Auckland. Having not been able to visit the town while we were based in Hahei, we dropped by on an overcast day on the way back to Auckland. The grey conditions suited to a long exposure and some of those birds obliged by staying still ! The wire frames made this one of the cooler jetties to photograph too and one day we'd love to spend some time here exploring the western corromandel and Kauearanga valley including the Pinnacles walk.

This is the second image from my two week long artist-in-residency appointment at Crater Lake National Park in October of 2014. 

The whitebark pines, such that you see in the photo, are one of the more astounding features of the park. Gnarled, twisted masses of wood centuries old. They've withstood weather extremes, intense winds, storms, droughts, you name it. The trees have stood strong and are some of the only species of pine that can survive the sub-alpine, rocky volcanic soil environment that is their home.

But they're dying. And not just a few here.. a few there. They're dying by the acre. In fact.. more than half of the whitebark pines in Crater Lake National Park are either dead or in the process of dying due to infestation by western pine beetles. The beetles have always been around, generally thriving in lower elevation forests, which are much more resistant to the infestations. However, with warmer and shorter winters, the beetles have been moving to higher elevations and persisting through the winter season. They attack these pines, which do not have the ability to defend themselves. In addition, the hotter, longer, and drier summers deprive these trees of the sap producing water they need to help their defense. It's one of the most 'in your face' effects of climate change within the park.

I can't help but think about this tree's future. It's an iconic tree in the park and one of my favorite features, and here it is, finally succombing to the environment that we have given it. These trees provide food, shelter, and survival for numerous other species, yet we have failed it's own survival. How much the park will change in the long-term by the death of these trees is still an unknown, but it will certainly continue to change the face of the park. 

Thanks for reading.
